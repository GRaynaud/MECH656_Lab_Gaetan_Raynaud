	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for ﬁrst-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the inﬁnity norm.},

	abstract = {Accurate and efﬁcient aeroelastic models are critically important for enabling the optimization and control of highly ﬂexible aerospace structures, which are expected to become pervasive in future transportation and energy systems. Advanced materials and morphing wing technologies are resulting in next-generation aeroelastic systems that are characterized by highly-coupled and nonlinear interactions between the aerodynamic and structural dynamics. In this work, we leverage emerging data-driven modeling techniques to develop highly accurate and tractable reduced-order aeroelastic models that are valid over a wide range of operating conditions and are suitable for control. In particular, we develop two extensions to the recent dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) algorithm to make it suitable for ﬂexible aeroelastic systems: 1) we introduce a formulation to handle algebraic equations, and 2) we develop an interpolation scheme to smoothly connect several linear DMDc models developed in different operating regimes. Thus, the innovation lies in accurately modeling the nonlinearities of the coupled aerostructural dynamics over multiple operating regimes, not restricting the validity of the model to a narrow region around a linearization point. We demonstrate this approach on a high-ﬁdelity, three-dimensional numerical model of an airborne wind energy (AWE) system, although the methods are generally applicable to any highly coupled aeroelastic system or dynamical system operating over multiple operating regimes. Our proposed modeling framework results in real-time prediction of nonlinear unsteady aeroelastic responses of ﬂexible aerospace structures, and we demonstrate the enhanced model performance for model predictive control. Thus, the proposed architecture may help enable the widespread adoption of next-generation morphing wing technologies.},

However, this traditional approach is mathematically cumbersome and only applies in asymptotic regimes where there is a strict separation of scales in the physics. Here, we automate and generalize this approach to non-asymptotic regimes by introducing the idea of an equation space, in which different local balances appear as distinct subspace clusters. Unsupervised learning can then automatically identify regions where groups of terms may be neglected. We show that our data-driven balance models successfully delineate dominant balance physics in a much richer class of systems.

	abstract = {This thesis develops several novel computational tools for system identification and data-driven forecasting. The material is divided into four chapters: data-driven identification of partial differential equations, neural network interpolation of velocity field data from trajectory measurements, smoothing of high dimensional nonlinear time series, and an application of data-driven forecasting in biology.
We first develop a novel computational method for identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) from measurements in the spatio-temporal domain. Building on past methods in sparse regression, we formulate a regression problem to select the active terms of a PDE from a large library of candidate basis functions. In contrast to many data-driven forecasting methods, the proposed algorithm yields exact representations of the dynamics. This has the advantage of allowing for future state prediction from novel initial and boundary conditions as well as rigorous mathematical analysis. The method is also extended to the case where coefficients vary either in space or time. We demonstrate the ability to accurately learn the correct active terms and their magnitudes on a variety on canonical partial differential equations.
We also develop a method for interpolating the velocity fields of smooth dynamical systems using neural networks. We specifically focus on addressing the issue of learning from noisy and limited data. We construct a cost function for training neural network interpolations of velocity fields from trajectory measurements that explicitly accounts for measurement noise. The need to numerically differentiate data is avoided by placing the neural network interpolation of velocity within an explicit timestepping scheme and training as a flow map rather than directly on the velocity field. The proposed framework is shown to be capable of learning accurate forecasting models even when data is corrupted by significant levels of noise. We also consider some limitations of using neural networks as forecasting models for dynamical systems. Using test problems with known dynamics, we show that neural networks are able to accurately interpolate a vector field only where data is collected and generally exhibit high generalization error. Some guidelines are proposed regarding the contexts in which neural networks may or may not be useful in practice.
For datasets where dynamics are known either completely or up to a set of parameters, we develop a novel smoothing technique based on soft-adherence to governing equations. The proposed method may be applicable to smoothing data from deterministic dynamical systems where high dimensionality or nonlinearity make sequential Bayesian methods impractical. We test the method on several canonical problems from data assimilation and show that it is robust to exceptionally high levels of noise as well as noise with non-zero mean and temporally autocorrelated noise.
The last section of this thesis develops a data-driven forecasting model for the half-sarcomere, a small component of skeletal muscle tissue. Current models of the half-sarcomere currently require computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulations to resolve the effects of filament compliance. We seek to replicate the dynamic behavior realized by Monte Carlo simulation of the half-sarcomere at a lower cost. Drawing inspiration from surrogate and reduced order modeling, we apply a course graining to the variables tracked by the Monte Carlo simulation and learn a dynamics model on the course grained variables using data. We find that the resulting data-driven model effectively reproduces force traces and dynamics of the course grained state when given novel input parameters.
Taken together, the innovations presented in this thesis represent a modest contribution to the field of data-driven methods for system identification and forecasting. In the concluding chapter, we highlight several exciting directions that build upon and improve the research presented in this thesis.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The objective of the present paper is to provide a challenging and well-defined validation test case for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in turbulent flow to close a gap in the literature. The following list of requirements are taken into account during the definition and setup phase. First, the test case should be geometrically simple which is realized by a classical cylinder flow configuration extended by a flexible structure attached to the backside of the cylinder. Second, clearly defined operating and boundary conditions are a must and put into practice by a constant inflow velocity and channel walls. The latter are also evaluated against a periodic setup relying on a subset of the computational domain. Third, the material model should be widely used. Although a rubber plate is chosen as the flexible structure, it is demonstrated by additional structural tests that a classical St. Venant-Kirchhoff material model is sufficient to describe the material behavior appropriately. Fourth, the flow should be in the turbulent regime. Choosing water as the working fluid and a medium-size water channel, the resulting Reynolds number of Re=30,470 guarantees a sub-critical cylinder flow with transition taking place in the separated shear layers. Fifth, the test case results should be underpinned by a detailed validation process. Methods: For this purpose complementary numerical and experimental investigations were carried out. Based on optical contactless measuring techniques (particle-image velocimetry and laser distance sensor) the phase-averaged flow field and the structural deformations were determined. These data were compared with corresponding numerical predictions relying on large-eddy simulations and a recently developed semi-implicit predictor-corrector FSI coupling scheme. Outcome: Both results were found to be in close agreement showing a quasi-periodic oscillating flexible structure in the first swiveling FSI mode with a corresponding Strouhal number of about StFSI=0.11.},

            This paper is concerned with the development of a hybrid data-driven technique for unsteady fluid-structure interaction systems. The proposed data-driven technique combines the deep learning framework with a projection-based low-order modeling. While the deep learning provides low-dimensional approximations from datasets arising from black-box solvers, the projection-based model constructs the low-dimensional approximations by projecting the original high-dimensional model onto a low-dimensional subspace. Of particular interest of this paper is to predict the long time series of unsteady flow fields of a freely vibrating bluff-body subjected to wake-body synchronization. We consider convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the learning dynamics of wake-body interaction, which assemble layers of linear convolutions with nonlinear activations to automatically extract the low-dimensional flow features. Using the high-fidelity time series data from the stabilized finite element Navier-Stokes solver, we first project the dataset to a low-dimensional subspace by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique. The time-dependent coefficients of the POD subspace are mapped to the flow field via a CNN with nonlinear rectification, and the CNN is iteratively trained using the stochastic gradient descent method to predict the POD time coefficient when a new flow field is fed to it. The time-averaged flow field, the POD basis vectors, and the trained CNN are used to predict the long time series of the flow fields and the flow predictions are quantitatively assessed with the full-order (high-dimensional) simulation data. The proposed POD-CNN model based on the data-driven approximation has a remarkable accuracy in the entire fluid domain including the highly nonlinear near wake region behind a freely vibrating bluff body.},

	abstract = {The stability analysis of elastic structures strongly coupled to incompressible viscous flows is investigated in this paper, based on a linearization of the governing equations formulated with the Arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian method. The exact linearized formulation, previously derived to solve the unsteady non-linear equations with implicit temporal schemes, is used here to determine the physical linear stability of steady states. Once discretized with a standard finite-element method based on Lagrange elements, the leading eigenvalues/eigenmodes of the linearized operator are computed for three configurations representative for classical fluid–structure interaction instabilities: the vortex-induced vibrations of an elastic plate clamped to the rear of a rigid cylinder, the flutter instability of a flag immersed in a channel flow and the vortex shedding behind a three-dimensional plate bent by the steady flow. The results are in good agreement with instability thresholds reported in the literature and obtained with time-marching simulations, at a much lower computational cost. To further decrease this computational cost, the equations governing the solid perturbations are projected onto a reduced basis of free-vibration modes. This projection allows to eliminate the extension perturbation, a non-physical variable introduced in the ALE formalism to propagate the infinitesimal displacement of the fluid–solid interface into the fluid domain.},

Thus by coupling an advanced LES code for the turbulent fluid flow with a code especially suited for the prediction of shells and membranes, an appropriate tool for the time-resolved prediction of instantaneous turbulent flows around light, thin-walled structures results. Based on an established benchmark case in laminar flow, i.e., the flow around a cylinder with an attached flexible structure at the backside, the entire methodology is analyzed thoroughly including a grid independence study. After this validation, the benchmark case is finally extended to the turbulent flow regime and predicted as a coupled FSI problem applying the newly developed scheme based on a predictor–corrector method. The entire methodology is found to be stable and robust. The turbulent flow field around the flexible structure and the deflection of the structure itself are analyzed in detail.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks are commonly trained using stochastic non-convex optimization procedures, which are driven by gradient information estimated on fractions (batches) of the dataset. While it is commonly accepted that batch size is an important parameter for ofﬂine tuning, the beneﬁts of online selection of batches remain poorly understood. We investigate online batch selection strategies for two state-of-the-art methods of stochastic gradient-based optimization, AdaDelta and Adam. As the loss function to be minimized for the whole dataset is an aggregation of loss functions of individual datapoints, intuitively, datapoints with the greatest loss should be considered (selected in a batch) more frequently. However, the limitations of this intuition and the proper control of the selection pressure over time are open questions. We propose a simple strategy where all datapoints are ranked w.r.t. their latest known loss value and the probability to be selected decays exponentially as a function of rank. Our experimental results on the MNIST dataset suggest that selecting batches speeds up both AdaDelta and Adam by a factor of about 5.},

	abstract = {In the context of science, the well-known adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" might well be "a model is worth a thousand datasets." Scientific models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simplifications of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientific basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are flexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simplified models without requiring "big data". In this work we develop a new methodology, universal differential equations (UDEs), which augments scientific models with machine-learnable structures for scientifically-based learning. We show how UDEs can be utilized to discover previously unknown governing equations, accurately extrapolate beyond the original data, and accelerate model simulation, all in a time and data-efficient manner. This advance is coupled with open-source software that allows for training UDEs which incorporate physical constraints, delayed interactions, implicitly-defined events, and intrinsic stochasticity in the model. Our examples show how a diverse set of computationally-difficult modeling issues across scientific disciplines, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to accelerating climate simulations by 15,000x, can be handled by training UDEs.},

	abstract = {Fishes often live in environments characterized by complex flows. To study the mechanisms of how fishes interact with unsteady flows, the periodic shedding of vortices behind cylinders has been employed to great effect. In particular, fishes that hold station in a vortex street (i.e., Kármán gaiting) show swimming kinematics that are distinct from their patterns of motion during freestream swimming in uniform flows, although both behaviors can be modeled as an undulatory body wave. Kármán gait kinematics are largely preserved across flow velocities. Larger fish have a shorter body wavelength and slower body wave speed than smaller fish, in contrast to freestream swimming where body wavelength and wave speed increases with size. The opportunity for Kármán gaiting only occurs under specific conditions of flow velocity and depends on the length of the fish; this is reflected in the highest probability of Kármán gaiting at intermediate flow velocities. Fish typically Kármán gait in a region of the cylinder wake where the velocity deficit is about 40\% of the nominal flow. The lateral line plays a role in tuning the kinematics of the Kármán gait, since blocking it leads to aberrant kinematics. Vision allows fish to maintain a consistent position relative to the cylinder. In the dark, fish do not show the same preference to hold station behind a cylinder though Kármán gait kinematics are the same. When oxygen consumption level is measured, it reveals that Kármán gaiting represents about half of the cost of swimming in the freestream.},

	doi = {10.5075/epfl-thesis-8363},
	abstract = {In 2050, the European commission plans to achieve actual energetic transition, which contributes in meeting the climate change challenges by moving away from the fossil fuels and by developing a competitive low-carbon economy. As a consequence, a foreseeable massive introduction of intermittent renewable energy sources in the transmission and distribution systems is going to occur, which will impact randomly the balance of the electric consumption and production, and could jeopardize the electric grid stability. In this context, the present research work aims at increasing the operation flexibility of Francis turbines at part load regime, which is thought to be one of the main solutions to mitigate the large power fluctuations of the electric grid arising from these intermittent power productions. An intense cavitation vortex rope is however known to appear in these operating conditions and to prohibit power generation due to large pressure fluctuations at a well-defined frequency, which causes risks of operating instability, and fatigue of the mechanical structures. The control of the part load vortex rope is therefore addressed in this research work using optimal flow control techniques. Minimization algorithms need a physically-based target characterizing this single helical structure, which is obtained by investigating the hydrodynamic instability properties of this turbulent open swirling flow. This approach is first developed on a benchmark open flow, the spiral vortex breakdown in laminar swirling flow. Global stability analysis about the mean flow is computed and reveals up to two unstable eigenmodes, which well predict the frequencies of the vortical structures of the nonlinear dynamics. Moreover, the computations of the nonlinear interactions of these purely hydrodynamic self-sustained instabilities help identifying a Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse route to chaos as the Reynolds number increases. The optimal control of spiral vortex breakdown, implemented through a minimization algorithm targeting the largest eigenvalue growth rate of the mean flow, results in a distributed force which succeeds in stabilizing the self-sustained instability. This promising approach next requires to transpose the uncluttered theoretical framework of laminar swirling flow to the complexity inherent to industrial design, including in particular turbulence modeling to reach high Reynolds number flows, Re = O(10⁶). The present work bridges this gap and presents an optimal control technique suitable for stabilizing the flow in hydraulic turbines. The part load vortex rope is identified as a global unstable eigenmode which originates from a single helical disturbance of the mean flow. This first result provides a linear framework to investigate the flow in hydraulic turbines and enables us to obtain the generation mechanism of the synchronous pressure fluctuations as a fluid-solid interaction using an asymptotic expansion. Based on the hydrodynamic instability properties of the part load vortex rope, the predictive control of this vortex is performed by targeting the most unstable eigenvalue growth rate of the draft tube mean turbulent flow. We determine an optimal force distribution that successfully quenches the vortex rope and sketches the design of a realistic control appendage. This result brings a promising solution to control the part load vortex rope and increase the operation flexibility of Francis turbines.},

	abstract = {State estimation is key to both analyzing physical mechanisms and enabling real-time control of ﬂuid ﬂows. A common estimation approach is to relate sensor measurements to a reduced state governed by a reduced-order model (ROM). (When desired, the full state can be recovered via the ROM). Current methods in this category nearly always use a linear model to relate the sensor data to the reduced state, which often leads to restrictions on sensor locations and has inherent limitations in representing the generally nonlinear relationship between the measurements and reduced state. We propose an alternative methodology where a neural network architecture is used to learn this nonlinear relationship. Neural network is a natural choice for this estimation problem, as a physical interpretation of the reduced state-sensor measurement relationship is rarely obvious. The proposed estimation framework is agnostic to the ROM employed, and can be incorporated into any choice of ROMs derived on a linear subspace (e.g., proper orthogonal decomposition) or a nonlinear manifold. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a two-dimensional model problem of separated ﬂow around a ﬂat plate, and is found to outperform common linear estimation alternatives.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work is to develop a procedure that allows for reconstructing three-dimensional flow fields from two-dimensional information contained in some representative planes, conveniently distributed throughout the domain. The reconstructing tool is based on two recent methods developed by two of the authors, namely the higher order dynamic mode decomposition and the spatio-temporal Koopman decomposition (STKD). The latter method decomposes a given spatio-temporal flow field as a series expansion in Fourier-like modes (including both wavenumbers/frequencies and spatial/temporal growth rates) in time and some distinguished longitudinal spatial coordinates, and spatial modes depending on the remaining transverse spatial coordinates. To obtain the (unknown) three-dimensional reconstruction, the STKD method is first applied to the (known) two-dimensional data in the considered planes. This application of STKD yields both the wavenumbers/frequencies and the spatial/temporal growth rates appearing in the three-dimensional reconstruction. Imposing that the three-dimensional reconstruction coincides with the two-dimensional data in the given set of planes, a system of linear equations results that permits computing the various ingredients appearing in the three-dimensional STKD expansion. The performance of the method is tested in the three-dimensional wake of a circular cylinder at Reynolds number (based on the cylinder diameter and the incoming free-stream velocity) equal to 280. The resulting flow is highly non-linear and quasi-periodic, with two fundamental temporal frequencies, associated with the well-known modes A and B. The method can be applied using experimental or numerical data, allowing to identify the full three-dimensional flow field and its main characteristics from limited information.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the passive flow control phenomena over a two-dimensional circular cylinder using numerical simulations in the laminar regime. The aim is to explore one of the passive control techniques, which involves the introduction of a slit to the geometry of the cylinder. The two parameters, slit width ratio S/D (slit width/diameter) and slit angle (measured with respect to the incoming flow direction), play an essential role in determining the trend of critical Reynolds number (Rec). Most of the analysis invokes flow visualization and saturation amplitude methods to obtain the critical Reynolds number (indicative of the onset of vortex shedding) for different cases. Furthermore, Hopf bifurcation analysis using the Stuart-Landau equation and global stability analysis confirm the accuracy and consistency in the predicted solutions. The additional amount of flow through the slit increases the pressure downstream of the cylinder, which consequently leads to an increase in Rec of the modified cylinder. The critical Reynolds number increases with S/D of the modified cylinder at 0○ slit angle (as an additional amount of flow grows with S/D). The critical Reynolds number shows an increasing trend with the slit angle in the range of S/D = 0.05–0.15 as the fluctuation intensity reduces with the slit angle in this range. For S/D = 0.15–0.25, the extra amount of flow through the slit induces instability in the wake, which causes a decrease in Rec with the slit angle. A correlation is obtained, which estimates the critical Reynolds number for a given S/D and slit angle.},

	abstract = {In this work we investigate the possibility of using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the Euler equations that model high-speed aerodynamic flows. In particular, we solve both the forward and inverse problems in one-dimensional and two-dimensional domains. For the forward problem, we utilize the Euler equations and the initial/boundary conditions to formulate the loss function, and solve the one-dimensional Euler equations with smooth solutions and with solutions that have a contact discontinuity as well as a two-dimensional oblique shock wave problem. We demonstrate that we can capture the solutions with only a few scattered points clustered randomly around the discontinuities. For the inverse problem, motivated by mimicking the Schlieren photography experimental technique used traditionally in high-speed aerodynamics, we use the data on density gradient ∇ρ(x,t), the pressure p(x∗,t) at a specified point x=x∗ as well as the conservation laws to infer all states of interest (density, velocity and pressure fields). We present illustrative benchmark examples for both the problem with smooth solutions and Riemann problems (Sod and Lax problems) with PINNs, demonstrating that all inferred states are in good agreement with the reference solutions. Moreover, we show that the choice of the position of the point x∗ plays an important role in the learning process. In particular, for the problem with smooth solutions we can randomly choose the position of the point x∗ from the computational domain, while for the Sod or Lax problem, we have to choose the position of the point x∗ from the domain between the initial discontinuous point and the shock position of the final time. We also solve the inverse problem by combining the aforementioned data and the Euler equations in characteristic form, showing that the results obtained by using the Euler equations in characteristic form are better than that obtained by using the Euler equations in conservative form. Furthermore, we consider another type of inverse problem, specifically, we employ PINNs to learn the value of the parameter γ in the equation of state for the parameterized two-dimensional oblique wave problem by using the given data of the density, velocity and the pressure, and we identify the parameter γ accurately. Taken together, our results demonstrate that in the current form, where the conservation laws are imposed at random points, PINNs are not as accurate as traditional numerical methods for forward problems but they are superior for inverse problems that cannot even be solved with standard techniques.},

	abstract = {We employ adaptive activation functions for regression in deep and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate smooth and discontinuous functions as well as solutions of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations. In particular, we solve the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, which has smooth solutions, the nonlinear Burgers equation, which can admit high gradient solutions, and the Helmholtz equation. We introduce a scalable hyper-parameter in the activation function, which can be optimized to achieve best performance of the network as it changes dynamically the topology of the loss function involved in the optimization process. The adaptive activation function has better learning capabilities than the traditional one (fixed activation) as it improves greatly the convergence rate, especially at early training, as well as the solution accuracy. To better understand the learning process, we plot the neural network solution in the frequency domain to examine how the network captures successively different frequency bands present in the solution. We consider both forward problems, where the approximate solutions are obtained, as well as inverse problems, where parameters involved in the governing equation are identified. Our simulation results show that the proposed method is a very simple and effective approach to increase the efficiency, robustness and accuracy of the neural network approximation of nonlinear functions as well as solutions of partial differential equations, especially for forward problems. We theoretically prove that in the proposed method, gradient descent algorithms are not attracted to suboptimal critical points or local minima. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive activation functions are shown to accelerate the minimization process of the loss values in standard deep learning benchmarks using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, MNIST, KMNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Semeion datasets with and without data augmentation.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as an alternative way of numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) without the need of building elaborate grids, instead, using a straightforward implementation. In particular, in addition to the deep neural network (DNN) for the solution, an auxiliary DNN is considered that represents the residual of the PDE. The residual is then combined with the mismatch in the given data of the solution in order to formulate the loss function. This framework is effective but is lacking uncertainty quantification of the solution due to the inherent randomness in the data or due to the approximation limitations of the DNN architecture. Here, we propose a new method with the objective of endowing the DNN with uncertainty quantification for both sources of uncertainty, i.e., the parametric uncertainty and the approximation uncertainty. We first account for the parametric uncertainty when the parameter in the differential equation is represented as a stochastic process. Multiple DNNs are designed to learn the modal functions of the arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) expansion of its solution by using stochastic data from sparse sensors. We can then make predictions from new sensor measurements very efficiently with the trained DNNs. Moreover, we employ dropout to quantify the uncertainty of DNNs in approximating the modal functions. We then design an active learning strategy based on the dropout uncertainty to place new sensors in the domain in order to improve the predictions of DNNs. Several numerical tests are conducted for both the forward and the inverse problems to demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs combined with uncertainty quantification. This NN-aPC new paradigm of physics-informed deep learning with uncertainty quantification can be readily applied to other types of stochastic PDEs in multi-dimensions.},

	abstract = {Despite tremendous progress seen in the computational fluid dynamics community for the past few decades, numerical tools are still too slow for the simulation of practical flow problems, consuming thousands or even millions of computational core-hours. To enable feasible multi-disciplinary analysis and design, the numerical techniques need to be accelerated by orders of magnitude. Reduced-order modeling has been considered one promising approach for such purposes. Recently, non-intrusive reduced-order modeling has drawn great interest in the scientific computing community due to its flexibility and efficiency and undergoes rapid development at present with different approaches emerging from various perspectives. In this paper, a brief review of non-intrusive reduced-order modeling in the context of fluid problems is performed involving three key aspects: i.e. dimension reduction of the solution space, surrogate models, and sampling strategies. Furthermore, non-intrusive reduced-order modelings regarding to some interesting topics such as unsteady flows, shock-dominating flows are also discussed. Finally, discussions on future development of non-intrusive reduced-order modeling for fluid problems are presented.},

	abstract = {The mechanical design of hydraulic turbines is conditioned by the dynamic response of the runner that is usually estimated by a computational model. Nevertheless, the runner has complex boundary conditions that are difficult to include in the computational model. One of these boundary conditions is the water in which the runner is submerged. The effect of the added mass and damping of water can modify considerably the natural frequencies of the runner. An experimental investigation in a reduced scale model of a turbine runner, using modal analysis, was carried out. Several impact tests with the runner freely suspended in air and in water were done. The response was measured with accelerometers located in different positions of the runner. From the modal analysis, the natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode-shapes were determined. The same mode-shapes obtained in air were obtained in water but with lower natural frequencies and higher damping ratios in water. The difference in the natural frequencies is shown to be dependant basically on the added mass effect of the water and not on its added damping. This difference also depends on the geometry of the mode, presenting different values for different mode-shapes. Using nondimensional values, the reduction in the natural frequencies can be extrapolated to other Francis runners presenting similar geometrical characteristics.},

	abstract = {With the improvement of technology and manufacturing level of hydraulic turbine, there is a trend to increase the power concentration of the units. As a consequence, heads, fluid velocities and rotational speeds are higher which lead to larger hydraulic excitation forces on the structures. Accordingly, vibration and high stress levels will arise, which may cause fatigue damage. Therefore, how to predict the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the runner during the design stage is of paramount importance. In this paper, numerical simulation to analyze the influence of the surrounding water in a pump-turbine runner modal has been carried out by using finite element method. The modal behavior of the runner in air and in water has been calculated. In addition, the added mass effect by comparing the natural frequencies and mode shapes in both cases has been determined. The results show that, due to the added mass effect of the surrounding water, natural frequencies are considerably reduced. The frequency reduction ratio (FRR) varies in a range of 0.06{\textasciitilde}0.43, depending on the mode shapes. Vibration amplitude and complexity of modes are the two main factors that affect the reduction ratio of runner natural frequencies. For the FRR of in-phase (IP) mode shapes, the vibration amplitude of each mode is considered to be the dominant reason. It is clear that the FRR decreases as the nodal diameter (ND) increases (except for 0ND). While for counterphase (CP) mode shapes, with the frequency increases, the runner modes will become more and more complex, as a result of which, the FRR increases.},

A part of the runner broke off during operation. This released a piece of the crown, which went through the machine, causing further damage. An analysis of the broken runner revealed a fatigue problem, so the dynamic/vibratory behavior of the runner during machine operation was investigated to determine the cause. First, the excitation forces acting on the runner during operation were studied. The main excitation in pump-turbines is generated by the interference between the rotating blades and the stationary vanes, known as a rotor-stator interaction (RSI), which produces large pressure pulsations. The amplitude of the pressure pulsations was measured in the prototype using pressure transducers. Second, the modal response of the runner structure was analyzed. A finite element (FEM) model of the runner was developed and the main natural frequencies and associated mode shapes were identified. A dynamic analysis was then performed to determine the runner response. A harmonic excitation simulating the pressure pulsation of the RSI was applied to the numerical model of the runner. The results showed a large stress concentration in the T-joint between the blade and crown where the crack originated. Finally, the possible causes of the damage are discussed.},

	abstract = {More efforts are put on hydro-power to balance voltage and frequency within seconds for primary control in modern smart grids. This requires hydraulic turbines to run at off-design conditions. especially at low load or speed-no load. Besides. the tendency of increasing power output and decreasing weight of the turbine runners has also led to the high level vibration problem of the runners. especially high head Francis runners. Therefore. it is important to carry out the static and dynamic stress analyses of prototype high head Francis runners. This paper investigates the static and dynamic stresses on the prototype high head Francis runner based on site measurements and numerical simulations. The site measurements are performed with pressure transducers and strain gauges. Based on the measured results. computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for the flow channel from stay vane to draft tube cone are performed. Static pressure distributions and dynamic pressure pulsations caused by rotor-stator interaction (RSI) are obtained under various operating conditions. With the CFD results. static and dynamic stresses on the runner at different operating points are calculated by means of the finite element method (FEM). The agreement between simulation and measurement is analysed with linear regression method. which indicates that the numerical result agrees well with that of measurement. Furthermore. the maximum static and dynamic stresses on the runner blade are obtained at various operating points. The relations of the maximum stresses and the power output are discussed in detail. The influences of the boundary conditions on the structural behaviour of the runner are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly recognized as a promising technology in the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences. There can be no argument that this technique is incredibly successful in image recognition with immediate applications in diagnostics including electrophysiology, radiology, or pathology, where we have access to massive amounts of annotated data. However, machine learning often performs poorly in prognosis, especially when dealing with sparse data. This is a ﬁeld where classical physics-based simulation seems to remain irreplaceable. In this review, we identify areas in the biomedical sciences where machine learning and multiscale modeling can mutually beneﬁt from one another: Machine learning can integrate physics-based knowledge in the form of governing equations, boundary conditions, or constraints to manage ill-posted problems and robustly handle sparse and noisy data; multiscale modeling can integrate machine learning to create surrogate models, identify system dynamics and parameters, analyze sensitivities, and quantify uncertainty to bridge the scales and understand the emergence of function. With a view towards applications in the life sciences, we discuss the state of the art of combining machine learning and multiscale modeling, identify applications and opportunities, raise open questions, and address potential challenges and limitations. This review serves as introduction to a special issue on Uncertainty Quantiﬁcation, Machine Learning, and Data-Driven Modeling of Biological Systems that will help identify current roadblocks and areas where computational mechanics, as a discipline, can play a signiﬁcant role. We anticipate that it will stimulate discussion within the community of computational mechanics and reach out to other disciplines including mathematics, statistics, computer science, artiﬁcial intelligence, biomedicine, systems biology, and precision medicine to join forces towards creating robust and eﬃcient models for biological systems.},

	abstract = {Fueled by breakthrough technology developments, the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences are now collecting more data than ever before. There is a critical need for time- and cost-efficient strategies to analyze and interpret these data to advance human health. The recent rise of machine learning as a powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity data, and reveal correlations between intertwined phenomena presents a special opportunity in this regard. However, machine learning alone ignores the fundamental laws of physics and can result in ill-posed problems or non-physical solutions. Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to integrate multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain the emergence of function. However, multiscale modeling alone often fails to efficiently combine large datasets from different sources and different levels of resolution. Here we demonstrate that machine learning and multiscale modeling can naturally complement each other to create robust predictive models that integrate the underlying physics to manage ill-posed problems and explore massive design spaces. We review the current literature, highlight applications and opportunities, address open questions, and discuss potential challenges and limitations in four overarching topical areas: ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, data-driven approaches, and theory-driven approaches. Towards these goals, we leverage expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, computational biology, biophysics, biomechanics, engineering mechanics, experimentation, and medicine. Our multidisciplinary perspective suggests that integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling can provide new insights into disease mechanisms, help identify new targets and treatment strategies, and inform decision making for the benefit of human health.},

	abstract = {Ce livre est issu d'un cours enseigné à l'École Polytechnique dont l'objectif, au delà de la présentation de l'analyse numérique et de l'optimisation, est d'introduire les étudiants au monde de la modélisation mathématique et de la simulation numérique. La modélisation et la simulation ont pris une importance considérable ces dernières décennies dans tous les domaines de la science et des applications industrielles (ou sciences de l'ingénieur). En effet, depuis leur apparition au lendemain de la seconde guerre mondiale les ordinateurs ont profondément transformé les mathématiques en en faisant une science expérimentale : on fait des " expériences numériques " (des calculs sur ordinateurs) comme d'autres font des expériences physiques. L'analyse numérique est justement la discipline qui conçoit et analyse les méthodes ou algorithmes de calcul. La simulation numérique permet aux mathématiciens de s'attaquer à des problèmes beaucoup plus complexes et concrets qu'auparavant, issus de motivations immédiates industrielles ou scientifiques, auxquels on peut apporter des réponses à la fois qualitatives mais aussi quantitatives : c'est la modélisation mathématique. Remarquons qu'à coté des champs d'applications traditionnels que sont la chimie, le mécanique et la physique se sont ouverts de nouvelles perspectives en biologie, environnement, finance, médecine et sciences sociales. Par ailleurs, l'ingénieur ou le scientifique qui a réussi à simuler numériquement son problème ne s'arrête pas en si bon chemin : il veut ensuite pouvoir intervenir sur certains paramètres pour améliorer ou optimiser le fonctionnement, le rendement, ou la réponse d'un système en maximisant (ou minimisant) des fonctions associées. C'est précisément le but de l'optimisation qui fournit des outils théoriques ou numériques pour ce faire. L'analyse numérique et l'optimisation sont donc deux outils essentiels et complémentaires de la modélisation mathématique. Des travaux pratiques de simulation numérique à l'aide des logiciels Scilab et FreeFem ++ accompagnent cet ouvrage et sont disponibles sur le site web http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/-allaire. Ce livre s'adresse en premier lieu aux étudiants des grandes écoles d'ingénieurs et des universités scientifiques en fin de licence ou première année de masters. Il peut par ailleurs permettre à des ingénieurs ou des chercheurs d'autres disciplines de se familiariser avec l'analyse numérique et l'optimisation.},

Provoqué par un glissement le long de la faille de San Andreas, le séisme a duré entre dix et quinze secondes et a atteint une magnitude de 6,9 sur l'échelle ouverte de Richter. Son épicentre a été localisé près de Loma Prieta Peak, dans les monts Santa Cruz, à environ seize kilomètres au nord-est de la ville de Santa Cruz,. Le séisme s'est ressenti principalement à San Francisco et Oakland. Il a provoqué la mort de 63 personnes, blessé 3 700 autres et laissé entre 3 000 et 12 000 personnes sans abri.
Le séisme se produisit alors qu'allait débuter au stade Candlestick Park de San Francisco le troisième match de la phase finale de la ligue majeure de baseball américaine (phase finale que les Américains appellent World Series ou Série mondiale, d'où le nom de World Series Earthquake parfois donné à ce tremblement de terre).

	abstract = {The increasing number of reported vibration serviceability problems in newly built pedestrian structures, such as footbridges and floors, under walking load has attracted considerable attention in the civil engineering community over the past two decades. The key design challenges are: the inter- and intra-subject variability of walking people, the unknown mechanisms of their interaction with the vibrating walking surfaces and the synchronisation between individuals in a group. Ignoring all or some of these factors makes the current design methods an inconsistent approximation of reality. This often leads to considerable over- or under-estimation of the structural response, yielding an unreliable assessment of vibration performance. Changes to the dynamic properties of an empty structure due to the presence of stationary people have been studied extensively over the past two decades. The understanding of the similar effect of walking people on laterally swaying bridges has improved tremendously in the past decade, due to considerable research prompted by the Millennium Bridge problem. However, there is currently a gap in knowledge about how moving pedestrians affect the dynamic properties of vertically vibrating structures. The key reason for this gap is the scarcity of credible experimental data pertinent to moving pedestrians on vertically vibrating structures, especially for multi-pedestrian traffic. This paper addresses this problem by studying the dynamic properties of the combined human-structure system, i.e. occupied structure damping ratio, natural frequency and modal mass. This was achieved using a comprehensive set of frequency response function records, measured on a full-scale test structure, which was occupied by various numbers of moving pedestrians under different walking scenarios. Contrary to expectations, it was found that the natural frequency of the joint moving human-structure system was higher than that of the empty structure, while it was lower when the same people were standing still. The damping ratio of the joint human-structure system was considerably higher than that of the empty structure for both the walking and standing people – in agreement with previous reports for stationary people - and was more prominent for larger groups. Interestingly, it was found that the walking human-structure system has more damping compared with the equivalent standing human-structure system. The properties of a single degree of freedom mass-spring-damper system representing a moving crowd needed to replicate these observations have been identified.},

	abstract = {The subject of this paper pertains to the contentious issue of synchronisation of walking pedestrians to lateral structural motion, which is the mechanism most commonly purported to cause lateral dynamic instability. Tests have been conducted on a custom-built experimental setup consisting of an instrumented treadmill laterally driven by a hydraulic shaking table. The experimental setup can accommodate adaptive pedestrian behaviour via a bespoke speed feedback control mechanism that allows automatic adjustment of the treadmill belt speed to that of the walker. 15 people participated in a total of 137 walking tests during which the treadmill underwent lateral sinusoidal motion. The amplitude of this motion was set from 5 to 15 mm and the frequency was set from 0.54 to 1.1Hz. A variety of stepping behaviours are identified in the kinematic data obtained using a motion capture system. The most common behaviour is for the timing of footsteps to be essentially unaffected by the structural motion, but a few instances of synchronisation are found. A plausible mechanism comprising an intermediate state between unsynchronised and synchronised pedestrian and structural motion is observed. This mechanism, characterised by a weak form of modulation of the timing of footsteps, could possibly explain the under-estimation of negative damping coefficients in models and laboratory trials compared with previously reported site measurements. The results from tests conducted on the setup for which synchronisation is identified are evaluated in the context of structural stability and related to the predictions of the inverted pendulum model, providing insight into fundamental relations governing pedestrian behaviour on laterally oscillating structures.},

The effects of stiffness, damping of the leg and the landing angle of attack are investigated in the numerical studies. Simulation results show that the dynamic interaction will increase with a larger vibration level of structure. More external energy must be input to maintain steady walking and uniform dynamic behavior of the pedestrian in the process.

By leveraging a residual network architecture, a near-identity transformation can be exploited to encode intrinsic coordinates in which the dynamics are linear. The resulting dynamics are given by a Koopman operator matrix \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{K\}\$. The decoder allows us to transform back to the original coordinates as well. Multiple time step prediction can be performed by repeated multiplication by the matrix \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{K\}\$ in the intrinsic coordinates. We demonstrate our method on a number of examples, including the heat equation and Burgers equation, as well as the substantially more challenging Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, showing that our method provides a robust architecture for discovering interpretable, linearizing transforms for nonlinear PDEs.},

In nature, 0deg is employed by dragonflies in acceleration mode while 180deg is usually in hovering mode. (ii) For forward flight, wing-wing interaction enhances forewing lift while reduced hindwing lift at all phase differences. Furthermore, the total lift was slightly reduced for gamma= 0deg to 90deg and significantly reduced by 18\% when gamma=270deg. The results consist well with the fact that, dragonflies usually employ 50deg to 100deg for forward flight, but seldom employ 270deg. PIV results are shown for wing-wing interaction analysis.},

              We present a new nonlinear mode decomposition method to visualize decomposed flow fields, named the mode decomposing convolutional neural network autoencoder (MD-CNN-AE). The proposed method is applied to a flow around a circular cylinder at the Reynolds number

              as a test case. The flow attributes are mapped into two modes in the latent space and then these two modes are visualized in the physical space. Because the MD-CNN-AEs with nonlinear activation functions show lower reconstruction errors than the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), the nonlinearity contained in the activation function is considered the key to improving the capability of the model. It is found by applying POD to each field decomposed using the MD-CNN-AE with hyperbolic tangent activation such that a single nonlinear MD-CNN-AE mode contains multiple orthogonal bases, in contrast to the linear methods, i.e. POD and MD-CNN-AE with linear activation. We further assess the proposed MD-CNN-AE by applying it to a transient process of a circular cylinder wake in order to examine its capability for flows containing high-order spatial modes. The present results suggest a great potential for the nonlinear MD-CNN-AE to be used for feature extraction of flow fields in lower dimensions than POD, while retaining interpretable relationships with the conventional POD modes.},

We show that an ensemble of solutions obtained using an arbitrarily precise numerical integrator can be used to train a deep artificial neural network (ANN) that, over a bounded time interval, provides accurate solutions at fixed computational cost and up to 100 million times faster than a state-of-the-art solver. Our results provide evidence that, for computationally challenging regions of phase-space, a trained ANN can replace existing numerical solvers, enabling fast and scalable simulations of many-body systems to shed light on outstanding phenomena such as the formation of black-hole binary systems or the origin of the core collapse in dense star clusters.},

We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various “no-flattening theorems” showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss; for example, we show that n variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2n2n2{\textasciicircum}n neurons in a single hidden layer.},

	abstract = {In computer vision, convolutional networks (CNNs) often adopt pooling to enlarge receptive field which has the advantage of low computational complexity. However, pooling can cause information loss and thus is detrimental to further operations such as features extraction and analysis. Recently, dilated filter has been proposed to tradeoff between receptive field size and efficiency. But the accompanying gridding effect can cause a sparse sampling of input images with checkerboard patterns. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-level wavelet CNN (MWCNN) model to achieve a better tradeoff between receptive field size and computational efficiency. The core idea is to embed wavelet transform into CNN architecture to reduce the resolution of feature maps while at the same time, increasing receptive field. Specifically, MWCNN for image restoration is based on U-Net architecture, and inverse wavelet transform (IWT) is deployed to reconstruct the high resolution (HR) feature maps. The proposed MWCNN can also be viewed as an improvement of dilated filter and a generalization of average pooling and can be applied to not only image restoration tasks, but also any CNNs requiring a pooling operation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MWCNN for tasks, such as image denoising, single image super-resolution, JPEG image artifacts removal and object classification.},

In the study, a novel hybrid deep-learning wind speed prediction model, which combines the empirical wavelet transformation and two kinds of recurrent neural network, is proposed. In the proposed new model, the empirical wavelet transformation is adopted to decompose the raw wind speed data into several sub-layers. The long short term memory neural network, a deep learning algorithm based method, is utilized to predict the low-frequency wind speed sub-layers. The Elman neural network, a mainstream recurrent neural network, is built to predict the high-frequency sub-layers.

elle peut mettre en œuvre une base différente, non forcément sinusoïdale ;
il existe une relation entre la largeur de l'enveloppe et la fréquence des oscillations : on effectue ainsi une homothétie de l'ondelette, et non seulement de l'oscillation.Toutefois, il ne s'agit pas d'un formalisme différent de la transformée de Fourier, mais complémentaire, la décomposition en ondelettes utilisant le formalisme de Fourier.

Our strategy extends the previous methods where porosity was taken into account in the absence of bending resistance of the structure and overcomes related numerical issues. The new strategy has been exploited to investigate how porosity affects the stability of slender elastic objects exposed to a uniform stream. To understand under which conditions porosity becomes important, we propose a simple resonance mechanism between a properly defined characteristic porous time-scale and the standard characteristic hydrodynamic time-scale. The resonance condition results in a critical value for the porosity above which porosity is important for the resulting filament flapping regime, otherwise its role can be considered of little importance. Our estimation for the critical value of the porosity is in fairly good agreement with our DNS results. The computations also allow us to quantitatively establish the stabilizing role of porosity in the flapping regimes.},

Within this passive propulsion mode, the body of the fish extracts sufficient energy from the oncoming vortices to develop thrust to overcome its own drag. In a similar turbulent wake and at roughly the same distance behind a bluff cylinder, a passively mounted high-aspect-ratio foil is also shown to propel itself upstream employing a similar flow energy extraction mechanism. In this case, mechanical energy is extracted from the flow at the same time that thrust is produced. These results prove experimentally that, under proper conditions, a body can follow at a distance or even catch up to another upstream body without expending any energy of its own. This observation is also significant in the development of low-drag energy harvesting devices, and in the energetics of fish dwelling in flowing water and swimming behind wake-forming obstacles.},

The three rigid bodies are connected by two frictionless hinges, and the system (‘fish’) is initially aligned with a streamwise axis three diameters behind the cylinder. Once flow symmetry is broken, the wake rolls up into a Kármán vortex street in which the fish is stably trapped, and the passing large-scale vortices induce an undulatory shape change in the articulated system. It is found that, for certain fish lengths relative to cylinder diameter, the fish is propelled upstream toward the cylinder. Furthermore, the fish is propelled equally effectively when the hinges are locked, confirming that induced body undulation is not necessary for achieving a net thrust. An analysis of the forces on constituent bodies shows that leading-edge suction and negative skin friction on the forward portion of the fish are in competition with positive skin friction on the aft portion; propulsion is achieved when the forebody contributions dominate those on the aftbody. It is shown that the so-called ‘suction zone’ behind the cylinder that enables this passive propulsion is double the length of that without a fish present.},

Neural networks are applied to all nodes on “artificial boundary”. The input vector for ANN is composed of (1) displacement, velocity and acceleration at time t−1 in node on the boundary, (2) displacements at time t−1 in three consecutive nodes on line perpendicular to the artificial boundary. The output vector determines the dynamic reactions at time t. Besides the displacements, velocities and accelerations at time t are computed. Three problems are discussed: (1) wave propagation in semi-infinite strip, (2) wave propagation in semi-infinite strip with notch, (3) acoustic radiation from nonconcentric radiator.

It has long been known that models with simple interaction rules can reproduce qualitative features of this complex behaviour. But determining whether these models accurately capture the biology requires data from real animals, which has historically been difficult to obtain. Here, we report three-dimensional, time-resolved measurements of the positions, velocities, and accelerations of individual insects in laboratory swarms of the midge Chironomus riparius. Even though the swarms do not show an overall polarisation, we find statistical evidence for local clusters of correlated motion. We also show that the swarms display an effective large-scale potential that keeps individuals bound together, and we characterize the shape of this potential. Our results provide quantitative data against which the emergent characteristics of animal aggregation models can be benchmarked.},

	abstract = {The organized flight of birds is one of the most easily observed, yet challenging to study, phenomena in biology. Birds that fly in organized groups generally do so in one of two fashions: Line formations and Cluster formations. The former groups are typical of large birds such as waterfowl, where birds fly arranged in single lines, often joined together. The scientific questions about these groups usually involve potential adaptive functions, such as why geese fly in a V. Cluster formations are typically made up of large numbers of smaller birds such as pigeons or starlings flying in more irregular arrangements that have a strong three-dimensional character. The groups are defined by synchronized and apparently simultaneous rapid changes in direction. Scientific questions about these groups are usually concerned with mechanism such as how synchrony is achieved. Although field observations about the phenomenon date to the origins of natural history, experimental studies did not begin until the 1970s. Early experimenters and theoreticians were primarily biologists, but more recently aeronautical engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists and, currently, physicists have been attracted to the study of organized flight. Computer modelling has recently generated striking visual representations of organized flight and a number of hypotheses about its functions and mechanisms, but the ability to test these hypotheses lags behind the capacity to generate them. We suggest that a multi disciplinary approach to the phenomenon will be necessary to resolve apparently conflicting current hypotheses.},

Here we report simultaneous measurements of the positions, velocities, and orientations as a function of time for up to a thousand wild-type Bacillus subtilis bacteria in a colony. The bacteria spontaneously form closely packed dynamic clusters within which they move cooperatively. The number of bacteria in a cluster exhibits a power-law distribution truncated by an exponential tail. The probability of finding clusters with large numbers of bacteria grows markedly as the bacterial density increases. The number of bacteria per unit area exhibits fluctuations far larger than those for populations in thermal equilibrium. Such “giant number fluctuations” have been found in models and in experiments on inert systems but not observed previously in a biological system.

	abstract = {Cell motility in viscous fluids is ubiquitous and affects many biological processes, including reproduction, infection and the marine life ecosystem. Here we review the biophysical and mechanical principles of locomotion at the small scales relevant to cell swimming, tens of micrometers and below. At this scale, inertia is unimportant and the Reynolds number is small. Our emphasis is on the simple physical picture and fundamental flow physics phenomena in this regime. We first give a brief overview of the mechanisms for swimming motility, and of the basic properties of flows at low Reynolds number, paying special attention to aspects most relevant for swimming such as resistance matrices for solid bodies, flow singularities and kinematic requirements for net translation. Then we review classical theoretical work on cell motility, in particular early calculations of swimming kinematics with prescribed stroke and the application of resistive force theory and slender-body theory to flagellar locomotion. After examining the physical means by which flagella are actuated, we outline areas of active research, including hydrodynamic interactions, biological locomotion in complex fluids, the design of small-scale artificial swimmers and the optimization of locomotion strategies.},

	abstract = {We examine the spatial dynamics of individuals in small schools of banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus) that exhibit rhythmic, oscillating speed, typically with sustained, coordinated, out-of-phase speed oscillations as they move around a shallow water tank. We show that the relative motion among the fish yields a periodically time-varying network of social interactions that enriches visually driven social communication. The oscillations lead to the regular making and breaking of occlusions, which we term “switching.” We show that the rate of convergence to consensus (biologically, the capacity for individuals in groups to achieve effective coordinated motion) governed by the switching outperforms static alternatives, and performs as well as the less practical case of every fish sensing every other fish. We show further that the oscillations in speed yield oscillations in relative bearing between fish over a range that includes the angles previously predicted to be optimal for a fish to detect changes in heading and speed of its neighbors. To investigate systematically, we derive and analyze a dynamic model of interacting agents that move with oscillatory speed. We show that coordinated circular motion of the school leads to systematic cycling of spatial ordering of agents and possibilities for enriched spatial density of measurements of the external environment. Our results highlight the potential benefits of dynamic communication topologies in collective animal behavior, and suggest new, useful control laws for the distributed coordination of mobile robotic networks.},

	abstract = {Through an extensive and systematic experimental investigation of two geometries of flexible plates in air, it is shown that a properly defined scaled Cauchy number allows collapsing all drag measurements of the reconfiguration number. In the asymptotic regime of large deformation, it is shown that the Vogel exponents that scale the drag with the flow velocity for different geometries of plates can be predicted with a simple dimensional analysis reasoning. These predicted Vogel exponents are in agreement with previously published models of reconfiguration. The mechanisms responsible for reconfiguration, namely area reduction and streamlining, are studied with the help of a simple model for flexible plates based on an empirical drag formulation. The model predicts well the reconfiguration observed in the experiments and shows that for a rectangular plate, the effect of streamlining is prominent at the onset of reconfiguration, but area reduction dominates in the regime of large deformation. Additionally, the model demonstrates for both geometries of plates that the reconfiguration cannot be described by a single value of the Vogel exponent. The Vogel exponent asymptotically approaches constant values for small and for very large scaled Cauchy numbers, but in between both extremes it varies significantly over a large range of scaled Cauchy number.},

However, the early tests have also uncovered some caveats of the DL approaches. We observe that the static DL scheme, implementing Convolutional GAN and trained on spatial snapshots of turbulence, fails to reproduce intermittency of turbulent ﬂuctuations at small scales and details of the turbulence geometry at large scales. We show that the dynamic NN schemes, namely LAT-NET and Compressed Convolutional LSTM, trained on a temporal sequence of turbulence snapshots are capable to correct for the caveats of the static NN.

This paper presents a method of using deep neural networks to learn a model for the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor from high-fidelity simulation data. A novel neural network architecture is proposed which uses a multiplicative layer with an invariant tensor basis to embed Galilean invariance into the predicted anisotropy tensor. It is demonstrated that this neural network architecture provides improved prediction accuracy compared with a generic neural network architecture that does not embed this invariance property. The Reynolds stress anisotropy predictions of this invariant neural network are propagated through to the velocity field for two test cases. For both test cases, significant improvement versus baseline RANS linear eddy viscosity and nonlinear eddy viscosity models is demonstrated.},

Such data-driven models, however, typically ignore physical insights from the scientiﬁc system under consideration. Among other things, a “physics-informed” model formulation should encode some degree of stability or robustness or well-conditioning (in that a small change of the input will not lead to drastic changes in the output), characteristic of the underlying scientiﬁc problem. We investigate whether it is possible to include physics-informed prior knowledge for improving the model quality (e.g., generalization performance, sensitivity to parameter tuning, or robustness in the presence of noisy data). To that extent, we focus on the stability of an equilibrium, one of the most basic properties a dynamic system can have, via the lens of Lyapunov analysis. For the prototypical problem of ﬂuid ﬂow prediction, we show that models preserving Lyapunov stability improve the generalization error and reduce the prediction uncertainty.},

In this paper, an approach to quantify flow-induced damping of a relatively heavy fluid on a vibrating hydraulic turbine blade using numerical simulations is presented. First, mode shapes and frequencies of the immersed structure are obtained by modal analysis using the finite element method. Then, forced oscillatory modal motion is prescribed on the structural boundary of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes flow simulations. Damping is finally computed as the normalized work done by the resulting fluid load on the structure. Validation is achieved by comparing the numerical results with available experimental data for a steel hydrofoil oscillating in flowing water. For this case, the linear increase in the damping ratio with the flow velocity is reproduced within 10\% of the experimental values. Application of the method to an actual hydroelectric propeller turbine blade yields a fluid damping value of around 15\% of critical damping for its first vibration mode.},

In particular, we seek to leverage the underlying conservation laws (i.e., for mass, momentum, and energy) to infer hidden quantities of interest such as velocity and pressure ﬁelds merely from spatio-temporal visualizations of a passive scaler (e.g., dye or smoke), transported in arbitrarily complex domains (e.g., in human arteries or brain aneurysms). Our approach towards solving the aforementioned data assimilation problem is unique as we design an algorithm that is agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions. This makes HFM highly ﬂexible in choosing the spatio-temporal domain of interest for data acquisition as well as subsequent training and predictions. Consequently, the predictions made by HFM are among those cases where a pure machine learning strategy or a mere scientiﬁc computing approach simply cannot reproduce. The proposed algorithm achieves accurate predictions of the pressure and velocity ﬁelds in both two and three dimensional ﬂows for several benchmark problems motivated by real-world applications. Our results demonstrate that this relatively simple methodology can be used in physical and biomedical problems to extract valuable quantitative information (e.g., lift and drag forces or wall shear stresses in arteries) for which direct measurements may not be possible.},

	abstract = {We developed a new class of physics-informed generative adversarial networks (PI-GANs) to solve in a unified manner forward, inverse and mixed stochastic problems based on a limited number of scattered measurements. Unlike standard GANs relying only on data for training, here we encoded into the architecture of GANs the governing physical laws in the form of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using automatic differentiation. In particular, we applied Wasserstein GANs with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for its enhanced stability compared to vanilla GANs. We first tested WGAN-GP in approximating Gaussian processes of different correlation lengths based on data realizations collected from simultaneous reads at sparsely placed sensors. We obtained good approximation of the generated stochastic processes to the target ones even for a mismatch between the input noise dimensionality and the effective dimensionality of the target stochastic processes. We also studied the overfitting issue for both the discriminator and generator, and we found that overfitting occurs also in the generator in addition to the discriminator as previously reported. Subsequently, we considered the solution of elliptic SDEs requiring approximations of three stochastic processes, namely the solution, the forcing, and the diffusion coefficient. We used three generators for the PI-GANs, two of them were feed forward deep neural networks (DNNs) while the other one was the neural network induced by the SDE. Depending on the data, we employed one or multiple feed forward DNNs as the discriminators in PI-GANs. Here, we have demonstrated the accuracy and effectiveness of PI-GANs in solving SDEs for up to 30 dimensions, but in principle, PI-GANs could tackle very high dimensional problems given more sensor data with low-polynomial growth in computational cost.},

The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) encode physical conservation laws and prior physical knowledge into the neural networks, ensuring the correct physics is represented accurately while alleviating the need for supervised learning to a great degree [1]. While eﬀective for relatively short-term time integration, when long time integration of the time-dependent PDEs is sought, the time-space domain may become arbitrarily large and hence training of the neural network may become prohibitively expensive. To this end, we develop a parareal physics-informed neural network (PPINN), hence decomposing a long-time problem into many independent short-time problems supervised by an inexpensive/fast coarse-grained (CG) solver. In particular, the serial CG solver is designed to provide approximate predictions of the solution at discrete times, while initiate many ﬁne PINNs simultaneously to correct the solution iteratively. There is a two-fold beneﬁt from training PINNs with small-data sets rather than working on a large-data set directly, i.e., training of individual PINNs with small-data is much faster, while training the ﬁne PINNs can be readily parallelized. Consequently, compared to the original PINN approach, the proposed PPINN approach may achieve a signiﬁcant speedup for long-time integration of PDEs, assuming that the CG solver is fast and can provide reasonable predictions of the solution, hence aiding the PPINN solution to converge in just a few iterations. To investigate the PPINN performance on solving time-dependent PDEs, we ﬁrst apply the PPINN to solve the Burgers equation, and subsequently we apply the PPINN to solve a two-dimensional nonlinear diﬀusion-reaction equation. Our results demonstrate that PPINNs converge in a couple of iterations with signiﬁcant speed-ups proportional to the number of time-subdomains employed.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), introduced in [M. Raissi, P. Perdikaris, and G. Karniadakis, J. Comput. Phys., 378 (2019), pp. 686--707], are effective in solving integerorder partial differential equations (PDEs) based on scattered and noisy data. PINNs employ standard feedforward neural networks (NNs) with the PDEs explicitly encoded into the NN using automatic differentiation, while the sum of the mean-squared PDE residuals and the meansquared error in initial-boundary conditions is minimized with respect to the NN parameters. Here we extend PINNs to fractional PINNs (fPINNs) to solve space-time fractional advection-diffusion equations (fractional ADEs), and we study systematically their convergence, hence explaining both fPINNs and PINNs for the first time. Specifically, we demonstrate their accuracy and effectiveness in solving multidimensional forward and inverse problems with forcing terms whose values are only known at randomly scattered spatio-temporal coordinates (black-box (BB) forcing terms). A novel element of the fPINNs is the hybrid approach that we introduce for constructing the residual in the loss function using both automatic differentiation for the integer-order operators and numerical discretization for the fractional operators. This approach bypasses the difficulties stemming from the fact that automatic differentiation is not applicable to fractional operators because the standard chain rule in integer calculus is not valid in fractional calculus. To discretize the fractional operators, we employ the Gru{\textbackslash}"nwald--Letnikov (GL) formula in one-dimensional fractional ADEs and the vector GL formula in conjunction with the directional fractional Laplacian in two- and three-dimensional fractional ADEs. We first consider the one-dimensional fractional Poisson equation and compare the convergence of the fPINNs against the finite difference method (FDM). We present the solution convergence using both the mean L2 error as well as the standard deviation due to sensitivity to NN parameter initializations. Using different GL formulas we observe first-, second-, and third-order convergence rates for small size training sets but the error saturates for larger training sets. We explain these results by analyzing the four sources of numerical errors due to discretization, sampling, NN approximation, and optimization. The total error decays monotonically (below 10 - 5 for a third-order GL formula) but it saturates beyond that point due to the optimization error. We also analyze the relative balance between discretization and sampling errors and observe that the sampling size and the number of discretization points (auxiliary points) should be comparable to achieve the highest accuracy. As we increase the depth of the NN up to certain value, the mean error decreases and the standard deviation increases, whereas the width has essentially no effect unless its value is either too small or too large. We next consider time-dependent fractional ADEs and compare white-box (WB) and BB forcing. We observe that for the WB forcing, our results are similar to the aforementioned cases; however, for the BB forcing fPINNs outperform FDM. Subsequently, we consider multidimensional time-, space-, and space-time-fractional ADEs using the directional fractional Laplacian and we observe relative errors of 10 - 3 {\textbackslash}sim  10 - 4. Finally, we solve several inverse problems in one, two, and three dimensions to identify the fractional orders, diffusion coefficients, and transport velocities and obtain accurate results given proper initializations even in the presence of significant noise.},

	abstract = {Data-driven discovery of “hidden physics”—i.e., machine learning of diﬀerential equation models underlying observed data—has recently been approached by embedding the discovery problem into a Gaussian process regression of spatial data, treating and discovering unknown equation parameters as hyperparameters of a “physics informed” Gaussian process kernel. This kernel includes the parametrized diﬀerential operators applied to a prior covariance kernel. We extend this framework to the data-driven discovery of linear space-fractional diﬀerential equations. The methodology is compatible with a wide variety of space-fractional operators in Rd and stationary covariance kernels, including the Mat´ern class, and allows for optimizing the Mat´ern parameter during training. Since fractional derivatives are typically not given by closed-form analytic expressions, the main challenges to be addressed are a user-friendly, general way to set up fractionalorder derivatives of covariance kernels, together with feasible and robust numerical methods for such implementations. Making use of the simple Fourier-space representation of space-fractional derivatives in Rd, we provide a uniﬁed set of integral formulas for the resulting Gaussian process kernels. The shift property of the Fourier transform results in formulas involving d-dimensional integrals that can be eﬃciently treated using generalized Gauss–Laguerre quadrature. The implementation of fractional derivatives has several beneﬁts. First, the method allows for discovering models involving fractional-order PDEs for systems characterized by heavy tails or anomalous diffusion, while bypassing the analytical diﬃculty of fractional calculus. Data sets exhibiting such features are of increasing prevalence in physical and ﬁnancial domains. Second, a single fractionalorder archetype allows for a derivative term of arbitrary order to be learned, with the order itself being a parameter in the regression. As a result, even when used for discovering integer-order equations, the proposed method has several beneﬁts compared to previous works on data-driven discovery of diﬀerential equations; the user is not required to assume a “dictionary” of derivatives of various orders and directly controls the parsimony of the models being discovered. We illustrate our method on several examples, including fractional-order interpolation of advection-diﬀusion and modeling relative stock performance in the S\&P 500 with α-stable motion via a fractional diﬀusion equation.},

As usual, aileron reversal or the blocking phenomenon of multijoint fixed ailerons is a hard nut to crack. In the present research, in order to improve aileron effectiveness, several examples are studied. The connection position influences the stress, displacement, load distribution, and control effectiveness of the aileron or critical flutter speed. As the joint positions are different, the wing-aileron connection stiffness is also changing. The sample of the beam shows the weight reduction. The plate simulation indicates the decreased deformation and the better load distribution. The aileron trimming demonstrates the improvement of aileron effectiveness. And the flutter speed coupled with the aileron is different. All of these examples indicate the feasibility of this new concept of the aileron design, which means improving aileron effectiveness based on changing the position of aileron connectors. Finally, three different modes for wing-aileron connections are suggested for reference.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in diverse applications; however, its use in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has emerged only recently. Here, we present an overview of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which embed a PDE into the loss of the neural network using automatic differentiation. The PINN algorithm is simple, and it can be applied to different types of PDEs, including integro-differential equations, fractional PDEs, and stochastic PDEs. Moreover, PINNs solve inverse problems as easily as forward problems. We propose a new residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) method to improve the training efficiency of PINNs. For pedagogical reasons, we compare the PINN algorithm to a standard finite element method. We also present a Python library for PINNs, DeepXDE, which is designed to serve both as an education tool to be used in the classroom as well as a research tool for solving problems in computational science and engineering. DeepXDE supports complex-geometry domains based on the technique of constructive solid geometry, and enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation. We introduce the usage of DeepXDE and its customizability, and we also demonstrate the capability of PINNs and the user-friendliness of DeepXDE for five different examples. More broadly, DeepXDE contributes to the more rapid development of the emerging Scientific Machine Learning field.},

By increasing the thickness-to-width ratio in the direct numerical simulations and thereby the non-dimensional moment of inertia we observe a transition from periodic fluttering to periodic tumbling with a wide transition region in which the cards flutter periodically but tumble once between consecutive turning points. In the transition region the period of oscillation diverges and the cards fall vertically for distances of up to 50 times the card width. We analyse the transition between fluttering and tumbling in the ODE model and find a heteroclinic bifurcation which leads to a logarithmic divergence of the period of oscillation at the bifurcation point.

The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier–Stokes, Schrödinger, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations.

	abstract = {This paper deals with the dynamics and stability of flexible pipes containing flowing fluid, where the flow velocity is either entirely constant, or with a small harmonic component superposed. An extensive historical review of the subject is given. In the case of constant flow velocity, the dynamics of the system is examined in a general way and it is shown that conservative systems are subject not only to buckling (divergence) at sufficiently high flow velocities, but also to oscillatory instabilities (flutter) at higher flow velocities. Also presented are some new results for cases of systems subjected to internal dissipative forces. In the case of harmonically varying flow velocity, the equation, of motion derived here exposes an error in a previous derivation. Stability, maps are presented for parametric instabilities, computed by Bolotin's method, for pipes with pined or clamped ends, as well as for cantilevered pipes. It is found that the extent of the instability regions increases with flow velocity for clamped-clamped and pinned-pinned pipes, while a more complex behaviour obtaines in the case of cantilevered pipes. In all cases, dissipation reduces the extent of, or entirely eliminates, parametric instability zones.},

Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a meshfree Lagrangian particle method and has special advantages in modeling complex fluid flows, especially those with large fluid deformations, fluid-structure interactions, and multi-scale physics. In this paper, we review the recent developments of SPH in methodology and applications for modeling complex fluid flows. Specifically, in methodology, some important issues including modified SPH particle approximation schemes for improving discretization accuracy, different particle regularization techniques, and various boundary treatment algorithms for solid boundary, free surface, or multiphase interface are described. More importantly, the SPH method with ideas from the dissipative particle dynamics for complex fluids in macro- or meso-scales is discussed. In applications, different complex fluid flows, including biological flows, microfluidics and droplet dynamics, non-Newtonian fluid flows, free surface flows, multiphase flows, and flows with fluid-structure interaction, are reviewed. Some concluding remarks in SPH modeling of complex fluid flows are provided.},

	abstract = {A new massively parallel scheme is developed to simulate free-surface flows with the meshless method incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (ISPH) for simulations involving more than 100 million particles. As a pressure-projection method, ISPH requires the solution of a sparse matrix for the pressure Poisson equation (PPE) which is non trivial for large problems where the particles are moving with continuously evolving sparsity. The new scheme uses a Hilbert space filling curve with a cell-linked list to map the entire domain so that domain decomposition and load balancing can be achieved easily to take advantage of geometric locality in order to reduce latency in memory cache access. The computational domain can be subdivided into more than 12,000 partitions using the message passing interface (MPI) for communication between partitions. Load balancing is achieved using the open-source Zoltan library using a new particle weighting system. To solve the PPE for large problems using tens of thousands of partitions, the open-source PETSc library is used which requires the HYPRE BoomerAMG preconditioner to ensure rapid convergence for ISPH. The performance of the code is benchmarked on the U.K. National Supercomputer ARCHER. The results show that domain decomposition with a space filling curve can efficiently treat irregularly distributed particles creating a well-balanced scheme demonstrating that the approach is well matched to the highly irregular subdomains and non-uniform distribution of ISPH free-surface simulations. The benchmark results show that massively parallel ISPH code can achieve over 90\% efficiency for the solution of the PPE, but the efficiency of computing matrix coefficients decreases when using more than 12000 partitions giving overall efficiencies in excess of 43\% up to 6144 MPI partitions, highlighting future improvements required. The work demonstrates that the Zoltan and PETSc libraries can be effectively combined with ISPH to offer the capability of developing a massively parallel ISPH toolkit.},

The coupled model of Finite Element and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (FE–SPH) is a robust technique for simulation of FSI problems. However, two important steps of neighbor searching and contact searching in the coupled FE–SPH model are extremely time-consuming. Point-In-Box (PIB) searching algorithm has been developed by Swegle to improve the efficiency of searching. However, it has a shortcoming that efficiency of searching can be significantly affected by the distribution of points (nodes in FEM and particles in SPH). In this paper, in order to improve the efficiency of searching, a novel Striped-PIB (S-PIB) searching algorithm is proposed to overcome the shortcoming of PIB algorithm that caused by points distribution, and the two time-consuming steps of neighbor searching and contact searching are integrated into one searching step. The accuracy and efficiency of the newly developed searching algorithm is studied on by efficiency test and FSI problems. It has been found that the newly developed model can significantly improve the computational efficiency and it is believed to be a powerful tool for the FSI analysis.},

We first introduce several parallel implementation techniques for the SPH code, and then examine these on our target computer architectures to determine the most effective algorithms for each processor unit. In addition, we evaluate the effective computing performance and power efficiency of the SPH simulation on each architecture, as these are critical metrics for overall performance in a multi-device environment. In our benchmark test, the GPU is found to produce the best arithmetic performance as a standalone device unit, and gives the most efficient power consumption. The multi-core CPU obtains the most effective computing performance. The computational speed of the MIC processor on Xeon Phi approached that of two Xeon CPUs. This indicates that using MICs is an attractive choice for existing SPH codes on multi-core CPUs parallelized by OpenMP, as it gains computational acceleration without the need for significant changes to the source code.},

This includes hydraulics applications and leads to some drawbacks such as severe artificial pressure fluctuations and a limitation to very small time steps related to the WCSPH Mach number and explicit method. This paper presents comparisons of a semi-implicit and truly incompressible SPH (ISPH) algorithm with the classical WCSPH method, showing how some of the problems encountered in WCSPH have been resolved by using ISPH to simulate incompressible flows. Mathematical models are presented before describing SPH formalism. Several standard boundary conditions are introduced and special attention is given to tracking the surface particles. The lid-driven cavity flow (Re=400 and 1000) is performed as a benchmarking test. A bluff body test case (a square cylinder in a closed channel, Red=20 and 100 based on the cylinder diameter) shows that pressure fields extracted from WCSPH are very unreliable whereas ISPH predict pressures and forces in closer agreement with classical finite volume CFD methods. Dam-breaking cases, with dry or wet beds downstream, are then presented to highlight free-surface flow and rapid dynamics effects. The WCSPH and ISPH results are generally verified with reference data from experiment and/or another numerical method. All the comparisons show improvement with ISPH and good agreement in general.},

	abstract = {Due to the high nonlinearities and extreme large deformation, the hypervelocity impact simulation is a challenging task for numerical methods. Meshfree particle methods, such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and material point method (MPM), are promising for the simulation of hypervelocity impact problems. In this paper, the material point method is applied to the simulation of hypervelocity impact problems, and a three-dimensional MPM computer code, MPM3D, is developed. The Johnson–Cook material model and Mie–Grüneisen equation of state are implemented. Furthermore, the basic formulations of MPM are compared with SPH, and their performances are compared numerically by using MPM3D and LS-DYNA SPH module.This study shows that the material point method is an efficient and promising method for simulating the hypervelocity impact problems. MPM possesses many prominent features. The formulation of MPM is simple and similar to the traditional finite element method (FEM). Spatial derivatives are calculated based on a regular computational grid in MPM, so that the time consuming neighbor searching, which is compulsory in most meshfree methods, is not required. The approximation of field variables and their spatial derivatives is efficiently evaluated using the information of only 8 grid nodes in three-dimensional problem, and the shape functions exactly satisfy the constant and linear consistency. The boundary conditions can be applied in MPM as easily as in FEM, and contact algorithm can be efficiently implemented whose cost is linear in the number of bodies. Because the same regular computational grid can be used in all time steps, the time step size keeps constant in MPM simulation.},

We address this problem by taking advantage of recent advances in scientific machine learning and the dynamically orthogonal (DO) and bi-orthogonal (BO) methods for representing stochastic processes. Specifically, we propose two new Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving time-dependent SPDEs, namely the NN-DO/BO methods, which incorporate the DO/BO constraints into the loss function with an implicit form instead of generating explicit expressions for the temporal derivatives of the DO/BO modes. Hence, the proposed methods overcome some of the drawbacks of the original DO/BO methods: we do not need the assumption that the covariance matrix of the random coefficients is invertible as in the original DO method, and we can remove the assumption of no eigenvalue crossing as in the original BO method. Moreover, the NN-DO/BO methods can be used to solve time-dependent stochastic inverse problems with the same formulation and computational complexity as for forward problems. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed methods via several numerical examples: (1) A linear stochastic advection equation with deterministic initial condition where the original DO/BO method would fail; (2) Long-time integration of the stochastic Burgers' equation with many eigenvalue crossings during the whole time evolution where the original BO method fails. (3) Nonlinear reaction diffusion equation: we consider both the forward and the inverse problem, including noisy initial data, to investigate the flexibility of the NN-DO/BO methods in handling inverse and mixed type problems. Taken together, these simulation results demonstrate that the NN-DO/BO methods can be employed to effectively quantify uncertainty propagation in a wide range of physical problems.},

This makes HFM highly flexible in choosing the spatio-temporal domain of interest for data acquisition as well as subsequent training and predictions. Consequently, the predictions made by HFM are among those cases where a pure machine learning strategy or a mere scientific computing approach simply cannot reproduce. The proposed algorithm achieves accurate predictions of the pressure and velocity fields in both two and three dimensional flows for several benchmark problems motivated by real-world applications. Our results demonstrate that this relatively simple methodology can be used in physical and biomedical problems to extract valuable quantitative information (e.g., lift and drag forces or wall shear stresses in arteries) for which direct measurements may not be possible.},

The solver consists of a deep neural network-structured actor that outputs candidate solutions, and a critic derived only from physical rules (governing equations and boundary and initial conditions). Solutions in discretized time are treated as multiple tasks sharing the same governing equation, and the current step parameters provide an ideal initialization for the next owing to the temporal continuity of the solutions, which shows a transfer learning characteristic and indicates that the DRL solver has captured the intrinsic nature of the equation. The approach is verified through solving the Schrödinger, Navier–Stokes, Burgers’, Van der Pol, and Lorenz equations and an equation of motion. The results indicate that the approach gives solutions with high accuracy, and the solution process promises to get faster.},

This paper presents a new numerical simulation based on the SPH method for FSI problems. The main contribution of this work is proposing new algorithms to model the contact between a viscous fluid and hypo-elastic solid particles. In the proposed contact model, the interpenetrations of fluid and solid particles are prevented by introducing a repulsive force and new intermediate particles. The validity of the proposed algorithms is verified, and in order to show their ability several examples are solved.},

However, CFD simulation is usually a computationally expensive, memory demanding and time consuming iterative process. These drawbacks of CFD limit opportunities for design space exploration and forbid interactive design. We propose a general and flexible approximation model for real-time prediction of non-uniform steady laminar flow in a 2D or 3D domain based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We explored alternatives for the geometry representation and the network architecture of CNNs. We show that convolutional neural networks can estimate the velocity field two orders of magnitude faster than a GPU-accelerated CFD solver and four orders of magnitude faster than a CPU-based CFD solver at a cost of a low error rate. This approach can provide immediate feedback for real-time design iterations at the early stage of design. Compared with existing approximation models in the aerodynamics domain, CNNs enable an efficient estimation for the entire velocity field. Furthermore, designers and engineers can directly apply the CNN approximation model in their design space exploration algorithms without training extra lower-dimensional surrogate models.},

Such models can be nowadays deployed on large patient-specific topologies of systemic arterial networks and return detailed predictions on flow patterns, wall shear stresses, and pulse wave propagation. However, their success heavily relies on tedious pre-processing and calibration procedures that typically induce a significant computational cost, thus hampering their clinical applicability. In this work we put forth a machine learning framework that enables the seamless synthesis of non-invasive in-vivo measurement techniques and computational flow dynamics models derived from first physical principles. We illustrate this new paradigm by showing how one-dimensional models of pulsatile flow can be used to constrain the output of deep neural networks such that their predictions satisfy the conservation of mass and momentum principles. Once trained on noisy and scattered clinical data of flow and wall displacement, these networks can return physically consistent predictions for velocity, pressure and wall displacement pulse wave propagation, all without the need to employ conventional simulators. A simple post-processing of these outputs can also provide a relatively cheap and effective way for estimating Windkessel model parameters that are required for the calibration of traditional computational models. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated through a series of prototype benchmarks, as well as a realistic clinical case involving in-vivo measurements near the aorta/carotid bifurcation of a healthy human subject.},

These dynamic loads are of special interest having produced catastrophic failures in pump-turbines. Determining RSI characteristics facilitates the proposal of actions that will prevent these failures. Pressure measurements all around the perimeter of the impeller-runner are appropriate to monitor and detect RSI characteristics. Unfortunately most installed pump-turbines are not manufactured with in-built pressure sensors in appropriate positions to monitor RSI. For this reason, vibration measurements are the preferred method to monitor RSI in industry. Usually vibrations are measured in two perpendicular radial directions in bearings where valuable information could be lost due to bearing response. In this work, in order to avoid the effect of bearing response on measurement, two vibration sensors are installed rotating with the shaft. The RSI characteristics obtained with pressure measurements were compared to those determined using vibration measurements. The RSI characteristics obtained with pressure measurements were also determined using vibrations measured rotating with shaft. These RSI characteristics were not possible to be determined using the vibrations measured in guide bearing. Finally, it is recommended to measure vibrations rotating with shaft to detect RSI characteristics in installed pump-turbines as a more practical and reliable method to monitor RSI characteristics.},

The flow field over an airfoil depends on the airfoil geometry, Reynolds number, and angle of attack. In conventional approaches, Navier-Stokes (NS) equations are solved on a computational mesh with corresponding boundary conditions to obtain the flow solutions, which is a time consuming task. In the present approach, the flow field over an airfoil is approximated as a function of airfoil geometry, Reynolds number, and angle of attack using deep neural networks without solving the NS equations. The present approach consists of two steps. First, CNN is employed to extract the geometrical parameters from airfoil shapes. Then, the extracted geometrical parameters along with Reynolds number and angle of attack are fed as input to the MLP network to obtain an approximate model to predict the flow field. The required database for the network training is generated using the OpenFOAM solver by solving NS equations. Once the training is done, the flow field around an airfoil can be obtained in seconds. From the prediction results, it is evident that the approach is efficient and accurate.},

Concerning on the turbine of one certain hydropower station, the flow field inside the turbine are first simulated and the pressure distribution around the blades are derived.

A Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) methodology by the means of ANSYS-CFX is applied on a reduced high head Francis turbine model. The reduced model consists of one stay vane, two guide vanes, one runner blade, one splitter and a full draft tube. Numerical simulation is first performed at BEP as well as PL to ensure the appropriate employment of turbulence models and boundary conditions. In the second step, the inlet boundary conditions are changed linearly from BEP to PL in order to achieve the transient conditions inside the draft tube. The initial condition of the second step is the converged BEP result. The transient simulation is continued until the RVR is fully developed in the draft tube at part load condition. The numerical results for BEP, PL and BEP to PL are in a good agreement with the experimental data. The effect of the RVR is considered from two aspects. The first one is the frequency, and the amplitude of the pressure pulsations induced by the RVR in the draft tube. The second one is the velocity field in the draft tube which is investigated over time during load rejection. Moreover, the flow structure is visualized using the λ2 criterion. The mechanism(s) of RVR formation and damping is accurately investigated by the presented approach. Furthermore, the results provide a better understanding of the physics behind the RVR formation. The obtained results aim to design an effective RVR controlling approach.},

	abstract = {Competitive electricity prices and reduced profit margins have forced hydraulic turbines to operate under critical conditions. The demand for extended operating ranges and the high efficiency of the turbine runners have forced manufacturers to produce lightweight runners. A turbine runner sometimes experiences resonance when a forced (flow-induced) excitation frequency approaches the runner’s natural frequency, resulting in failure. The cost of structural failure after commissioning is prohibitive. To attain a reliable and safe runner design, understanding of the structural response to flow-induced excitations is important. High amplitude pressure pulsations cause fatigue loading of the blades, which develop cracks over time. The amplitudes are dependent on the flow conditions, type of turbine and stator/rotor vane combinations. The structural response is dependent on the material properties, flow-induced damping and natural frequencies. Moreover, in a hydraulic turbine, changes in flow velocity from less than 1ms−1 to over 40ms−1 create challenges in predicting the response. The main objective of this article is to review the studies conducted on fluid-structure interactions within hydraulic turbines. Several aspects are reviewed, such as flow-induced excitation, added mass effect, hydrodynamic damping, and blade flutter. Both experimental and numerical studies are discussed in this article. This review also discusses the consequences of an increased number of transient cycles, such as load variation, start-stop and total load rejection, on the turbines and the fatigue loading. Finally, an attempt is made to highlight the important requirements for prospective fluid-structure analysis to fill current gaps in the literature.},

The cracks are thought to be due to dynamic stresses in the runner caused by hydraulic forces. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that included the spiral case, stay vane, guide vane, runner vane, and draft tube were run at various operating points to analyze the pressure distribution on the runner surface and the stress characteristics in the runner due to the fluid-structure interactions (FSI). The dynamic stresses in the Francis turbine runner at the most dangerous operating point were then analyzed. The results show that the dynamic stresses caused by the hydraulic forces during off-design operating points are one of the main reasons for the fatigue and cracks in the runner blade. The results can be used to optimize the runner and to analyze other critical components in the hydraulic turbine.},

	abstract = {Overfitting frequently occurs in deep learning. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization method called Drop-Activation to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. The key idea is to drop nonlinear activation functions by setting them to be identity functions randomly during training time. During testing, we use a deterministic network with a new activation function to encode the average effect of dropping activations randomly. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, EMNIST, and ImageNet show that Drop-Activation generally improves the performance of popular neural network architectures. Furthermore, unlike dropout, as a regularizer Drop-Activation can be used in harmony with standard training and regularization techniques such as Batch Normalization and AutoAug. Our theoretical analyses support the regularization effect of Drop-Activation as implicit parameter reduction and verify its capability to be used together with Batch Normalization.

Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages.

	abstract = {Data-driven discovery of “hidden physics''---i.e., machine learning of differential equation models underlying observed data---has recently been approached by embedding the discovery problem into a Gaussian process regression of spatial data, treating and discovering unknown equation parameters as hyperparameters of a “physics informed” Gaussian process kernel. This kernel includes the parametrized differential operators applied to a prior covariance kernel. We extend this framework to the  data-driven discovery  of linear space-fractional differential equations. The methodology is compatible with a wide variety of space-fractional operators in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$ and stationary covariance kernels, including the Matérn class, and allows for optimizing the Matérn parameter during training. Since fractional derivatives are typically not given by closed-form analytic expressions, the main challenges to be addressed are a user-friendly, general way to set up fractional-order derivatives of covariance kernels, together with feasible and robust numerical methods for such implementations. Making use of the simple Fourier-space representation of space-fractional derivatives in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$, we provide a unified set of integral formulas for the resulting Gaussian process kernels. The shift property of the Fourier transform results in formulas involving \$d\$-dimensional integrals that can be efficiently treated using generalized Gauss--Laguerre quadrature. The implementation of fractional derivatives has several benefits. First, the method allows for discovering models involving fractional-order PDEs for systems characterized by heavy tails or anomalous diffusion, while bypassing the analytical difficulty of fractional calculus. Data sets exhibiting such features are of increasing prevalence in physical and financial domains. Second,  a single fractional-order archetype allows for a derivative term of arbitrary order to be learned, with the order itself being a parameter in the regression. As a result, even when used for discovering integer-order equations, the proposed method has several benefits compared to previous works on data-driven discovery of differential equations; the user is not required to assume a “dictionary” of derivatives of various orders and directly controls the parsimony of the models being discovered. We illustrate our method on several examples, including fractional-order interpolation of advection-diffusion and modeling relative stock performance in the S\&P 500 with \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-stable motion via a fractional diffusion equation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the Entropically Damped Artificial Compressibility (EDAC) formulation of Clausen (2013) is used in the context of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method for the simulation of incompressible fluids. Traditionally, weakly-compressible SPH (WCSPH) formulations have employed artificial compressiblity to simulate incompressible fluids. EDAC is an alternative to the artificial compressiblity scheme wherein a pressure evolution equation is solved in lieu of coupling the fluid density to the pressure by an equation of state. The method is explicit and is easy to incorporate into existing SPH solvers using the WCSPH formulation. This is demonstrated by coupling the EDAC scheme with the recently proposed Transport Velocity Formulation (TVF) of Adami et al. (2013). The method works for both internal flows and for flows with a free surface (a drawback of the TVF scheme). Several benchmark problems are considered to evaluate the proposed scheme and it is found that the EDAC scheme gives results that are as good or sometimes better than those produced by the TVF or standard WCSPH. The scheme is robust and produces smooth pressure distributions and does not require the use of an artificial viscosity in the momentum equation although using some artificial viscosity is beneficial.},

In this work, the training data are obtained from high fidelity model solutions at selected time levels. The long short-term memory network is used to construct a set of hypersurfaces representing the reduced fluid dynamic system. The model reduction method developed here is independent of the source code of the full physical system. The reduced order model based on deep learning has been implemented within an unstructured mesh finite element fluid model. The performance of the new reduced order model is evaluated using 2 numerical examples: an ocean gyre and flow past a cylinder. These results illustrate that the CPU cost is reduced by several orders of magnitude whilst providing reasonable accuracy in predictive numerical modelling.},

Of interest is the prediction of the lift and drag forces on the structure given some limited and scattered information on the velocity field. This is an inverse problem that is not straightforward to solve using standard computational fluid dynamics methods, especially since no information is provided for the pressure. An even greater challenge is to infer the lift and drag forces given some dye or smoke visualizations of the flow field. Here we employ deep neural networks that are extended to encode the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations coupled with the structure’s dynamic motion equation. In the first case, given scattered data in space–time on the velocity field and the structure’s motion, we use four coupled deep neural networks to infer very accurately the structural parameters, the entire time-dependent pressure field (with no prior training data), and reconstruct the velocity vector field and the structure’s dynamic motion. In the second case, given scattered data in space–time on a concentration field only, we use five coupled deep neural networks to infer very accurately the vector velocity field and all other quantities of interest as before. This new paradigm of inference in fluid mechanics for coupled multi-physics problems enables velocity and pressure quantification from flow snapshots in small subdomains and can be exploited for flow control applications and also for system identification.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel model reduction method: deep learning reduced order model, which is based on proper orthogonal decomposition and deep learning methods. The deep learning approach is a recent technological advancement in the field of artificial neural networks. It has the advantage of learning the nonlinear system with multiple levels of representation and predicting data. In this work, the training data are obtained from high fidelity model solutions at selected time levels. The long short-term memory network is used to construct a set of hypersurfaces representing the reduced fluid dynamic system. The model reduction method developed here is independent of the source code of the full physical system. The reduced order model based on deep learning has been implemented within an unstructured mesh finite element fluid model. The performance of the new reduced order model is evaluated using 2 numerical examples: an ocean gyre and flow past a cylinder. These results illustrate that the CPU cost is reduced by several orders of magnitude whilst providing reasonable accuracy in predictive numerical modelling.},

The purpose of this study is the investigation of the effects of theoretical turbine runner parameters on the design. To determine the parameter effects on the turbine performance theoretical calculations and analyses of turbine runner were performed. A methodology was followed with the help of CFD to reach the best efficiency operating point of turbine. Starting from the preliminary design to the final design, theoretical calculations were performed and evaluated using the results of the CFD analyses. The CFD analyses were used to visualize the flow characteristics on runner blades induced by runner parameters. At the end, a new runner model is designed with a higher efficiency.},

	abstract = {This study experimentally demonstrates that a closely spaced array of aeroelastic flutter energy harvesters can exploit
synergistic wake interactions to outperform the same number of harvesters operating in isolation. The fluttering motion
of each energy harvester imparts an oscillating vortex wake into the flow downstream of the device. Wind tunnel
experiments with arrays of two and four flutter energy harvesters show that this wake structure has significant effects
on the vibration amplitude, frequency, and power output of the trailing devices. These wake interaction effects are
shown to vary with the stream-wise and cross-stream separation distance between the harvesters. Over a defined range
of separations, an advantageous frequency lock-in between the devices arises. When this occurs, the trailing harvesters
can extract additional energy from the wake of upstream harvesters, causing larger oscillation amplitudes and higher
power output in the trailing devices. Experiments to characterize this variation in power output due to these wake inter-
action effects and to determine the optimal spacing of the energy harvesters are presented and discussed. Smoke-wire
flow visualization is used to examine the wake structure and investigate the mechanism of the array interactions.},

	url = {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01461619},
	abstract = {In this thesis a novel non-body conforming mesh formulation is developed, called the moving immersed boundary method (MIBM), for the numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The primary goal is to enable solids of complex shape to move arbitrarily in an incompressible viscous fluid, without fitting the solid boundary motion with dynamic meshes. This novel method enforces the no-slip boundary condition exactly at the fluid-solid interface with a boundary force, without introducing any artificial constants to the rigid body formulation. As a result, large time step can be used in current method. To determine the boundary force more efficiently in case of moving boundaries, an additional moving force equation is derived and the resulting system is solved by the conjugate gradient method. The proposed method is highly portable and can be integrated into any fluid solver as a plug-in. In the present thesis, the MIBM is implemented in the fluid solver based on the projection method. In order to obtain results of high accuracy, the rotational incremental pressure correction projection method is adopted, which is free of numerical boundary layer and is second order accurate. To accelerate the calculation of the pressure Poisson equation, the multi-grid method is employed as a preconditioner together with the conjugate gradient method as a solver. The code is further parallelized on the graphics processing unit (GPU) with the CUDA library to enjoy high performance computing. At last, the proposed MIBM is applied to the study of two-way FSI problem. For stability and modularity reasons, a partitioned implicit scheme is selected for this strongly coupled problem. The interface matching of fluid and solid variables is realized through a fixed point iteration. To reduce the computational cost, a novel efficient coupling scheme is proposed by removing the time-consuming pressure Poisson equation from this fixed point interaction. The proposed method has shown a promising performance in modeling complex FSI system.},

It has long been known that models with simple interaction rules can reproduce qualitative features of this complex behaviour. But determining whether these models accurately capture the biology requires data from real animals, which has historically been difficult to obtain. Here, we report three-dimensional, time-resolved measurements of the positions, velocities, and accelerations of individual insects in laboratory swarms of the midge Chironomus riparius. Even though the swarms do not show an overall polarisation, we find statistical evidence for local clusters of correlated motion. We also show that the swarms display an effective large-scale potential that keeps individuals bound together, and we characterize the shape of this potential. Our results provide quantitative data against which the emergent characteristics of animal aggregation models can be benchmarked.},

The coherent vortical structures present in this flow generate a periodic forcing on the beam which when tuned to its resonant frequency produces maximum output voltage. There are two mechanisms that contribute to the driving forcing of the beam. The first mechanism is the impingement of induced flow by the passing vortices on one side of the beam, and the second is the low pressure core region of the vortices which is present at the opposite side of the beam. The sequence of these two mechanisms combined with the resonating conditions of the beam generated maximum energy output which was also found to vary with the location in the wake. The maximum power output was measured when the tip of the beam is about two diameters downstream of the cylinder. This power drops off the center line of the wake and decays with downstream distance as (x/D)−3/2.},

	abstract = {Blade–vortex interaction noise-generated by helicopter main rotor blades is one of the most severe noise problems and is very important both in military applications and community acceptance of rotorcraft. Research over the decades has substantially improved physical understanding of noise-generating mechanisms, and various design concepts have been investigated to control noise radiation using advanced blade planform shapes and active blade control techniques. The important parameters to control rotor blade–vortex interaction noise and vibration have been identified: blade tip vortex structures and its trajectory, blade aeroelastic deformation, and airloads. Several blade tip design concepts have been investigated for diffusing tip vortices and also for reducing noise. However, these tip shapes have not been able to substantially reduce blade–vortex interaction noise without degradation of rotor performance. Meanwhile, blade root control techniques, such as higher-harmonic pitch control (HHC) and individual blade control (IBC) concepts, have been extensively investigated for noise and vibration reduction. The HHC technique has proved the substantial blade–vortex interaction noise reduction, up to 6dB, while vibration and low-frequency noise have been increased. Tests with IBC techniques have shown the simultaneous reduction of rotor noise and vibratory loads with 2/rev pitch control inputs. Recently, active blade control concepts with smart structures have been investigated with the emphasis on active blade twist and trailing edge flap. Smart structures technologies are very promising, but further advancements are needed to meet all the requirements of rotorcraft applications in frequency, force, and displacement.},

	abstract = {Energetic benefit and enhanced performance are considered among the most fascinating achievements of collective behaviours, e.g. fish schools and flying formations. The collective locomotion of two self-propelled flapping plates initially in a side-by-side arrangement is investigated numerically. Both in-phase and antiphase oscillations for the two plates are considered. It is found that the plates will spontaneously form some stable configurations as a result of the flow-mediated interaction, specifically, the staggered-following (SF) mode and the alternate-leading (AL) mode for the in-phase scenario and the moving abreast (MA) mode and the AL mode for the antiphase scenario. In the SF mode, the rear plate follows the front one with a staggered configuration. In the AL mode, the plates chase each other side-by-side alternately. In terms of propulsive speed and efficiency, the performance of the plates in the SF mode with small lateral spacing
              
                
                  
                  \$H\$
                
              
              is found to be better than those in the tandem following case (

              , are preferred and they should be close enough in the lateral direction. For the side-by-side configuration, the performance of each plate in the antiphase and in-phase scenarios is enhanced and weakened in comparison with that of the isolated plate, respectively. Besides the pressure and vorticity contours, the normal force and thrust acting on the plates are also analysed. It is revealed that the thrust is mainly contributed by the normal force at moderate bending stiffness. The normal force and thrust are critical to the propulsive speed and efficiency. For two self-propelled plates, in view of hydrodynamics, to achieve higher performance the in-phase SF mode and antiphase flappings in the side-by-side configuration are preferred.},

Fluid Mech. 506, 147–155] has shown that an axle-mounted blade can spontaneously rotate when oscillated (or “flapped”) above a critical frequency in a fluid. To understand the nature of flapping locomotion we study numerically the dynamics of a simple body, flapped up and down within a viscous fluid and free to move horizontally. We show here that, at sufficiently large “frequency Reynolds number,” unidirectional locomotion emerges as an attracting state for an initially nonlocomoting body. Locomotion is generated in two stages: first, the fluid field loses symmetry by an instability similar to the classical von Kármán instability; and second, precipitous interactions with previously shed vortical structures “push” the body into locomotion. Body mass and slenderness play central and unexpected roles in each stage. Conceptually, this work demonstrates how locomotion can be transduced from the simple oscillations of a body through an interaction with its fluid environment.},

The mutual forcing terms are based on exact transfer of energy from the fluid to the structural oscillator. This leads to a system with distinct frequency locking and resonance when fluid and structural natural frequencies are similar. The present work implements a simple quadratic fluid damping, but more general fluid damping can be introduced without changing the basic features of the model. The response curve for stationary oscillations consists of two distinct branches, separated by jumps in frequency, amplitude, and phase closely resembling experimentally observed free vortex-induced vibrations. A stability analysis shows that the final part of each branch is unstable, and a transient analysis illustrates the transition between the two modes of oscillation for slowly increasing or decreasing fluid velocity through the lock-in region. Model calibration is discussed and parameters are identified representing available experimental data for lock-in frequencies and resonance amplitudes for systems with relative structural damping in the interval 1.5-3.0 x 10(-3) and different values of the mass ratio.},

The Reynolds number range covered is from about Re=47 to 2×105, i.e., from the onset of vortex shedding up to the end of the subcritical regime. At the beginning of the subcritical regime (Re≃0.3×103) a spanwise correlation length of about 30 cylinder diameters is indicated, the correlation function being based on near-cylinder velocity fluctuations in outer parts of the separated shear layer. In between Reynolds numbers 1.6×103 and 20×103, an approximate 10-fold increase in the sectional r.m.s. lift coefficient is indicated. This range contains a fundamental change-over from one flow state to another, starting off at Re≃5×103 and seemingly fully developed at Re≃8×103.},

Measurements have been made of the response characteristics and flow fields about circular cylinders that were mounted on springs in a wind tunnel. Free stream Reynolds numbers for two of the cylindrical models ranged respectively from 350 to 550 and from 550 to 900. The measured vibration frequencies, amplitudes of vibration, and phase angles between oscillatory lift and motion are compared with predictions made with an heuristic wake oscillator model for the vortex-excited vibrations. Steady drag measurements were made and show that the drag coefficient increases by as much as 75\% at the maximum vibration amplitude from the measured stationary cylinder value. A series of flow visualization photographs were taken during a portion of the shedding cycle and the observed flow field is compared with fluid velocity and cylinder motion measurements recorded simultaneously near the model. Lift amplification and energy transfer from the flow during resonance are compared over the range of the experiments. The photographs give qualitative evidence to support the physical model recently proposed by Gerrard for the vortex formation region and the transfer of circulation in the base region of a bluff body.},

	abstract = {A new twist on an old model for predicting the vortex-excited vibrations of flexible cylindrical structures is developed. A van der Pol equation, driven by the local transverse motion of the cylinder, is taken as the governing equation for one component of the fluctuating lift force on the cylinder. The second component of the lift force is represented by a stall term which is linearly proportional to the local transverse velocity of the cylinder. In previous models, the van der Pol equation has been employed as the governing equation for the entire fluctuating lift force on the cylinder. The new model preserves the modal scaling principle for the structural response, as initially predicted by the previous models and since verified experimentally. The empirical parameters in the model are related to the physical mass and damping parameters that define the structural properties so that the maximum structural response and the reduced velocity at which it occurs agree with experimental observations. Because of the stall term, the new model provides for an asymptotic, self-limiting structural response at zero structural damping. This asymptotic, self-limiting behavior was not captured by the previous models.},

Energy expenditure and efficiency are evaluated using a cost of transport function, while the effect of schooling on the stability of each swimmer is examined by probing the lateral force and the lateral and longitudinal force fluctuations. We construct full maps of the aforementioned quantities as functions of the spatial pattern of the swimming fish pair and show that both energy expenditure and stability can be invoked as possible reasons for the swimming patterns and tail-beat synchronization observed in real fish. Our results suggest that high cost of transport zones should be avoided by the fish. Wake capture may be energetically unfavorable in the absence of kinematic adjustment. We hereby hypothesize that fish may restrain from wake capturing and, instead, adopt side-to-side configuration as a conservative strategy, when the conditions of wake energy harvesting are not satisfied. To maintain a stable school configuration, compromise between propulsive efficiency and stability, as well as between school members, ought to be considered.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The swimmer propels itself by tangential or normal surface motion in a tube whose radius is of the order of the swimmer size. Hydrodynamic interactions with the tube walls significantly affect the average swimming speed and power consumption of the model microorganism. In the case of swimming parallel to the tube axis, the locomotion speed is always reduced (respectively, increased) for swimmers with tangential (respectively, normal) deformation. In all cases, the rate of work necessary for swimming is increased by confinement. Swimmers with no force dipoles in the far field generally follow helical trajectories, solely induced by hydrodynamic interactions with the tube walls, and in qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations for Paramecium. Swimmers of the puller type always display stable locomotion at a location which depends on the strength of their force dipoles: swimmers with weak dipoles (small

The influence of hydrodynamics on such collectives has been relatively unexplored theoretically, in part due to the difficulty in modeling the temporally long-lived hydrodynamic interactions between many dynamic bodies. We address this through a novel discrete-time dynamical system (iterated map) that describes the hydrodynamic interactions between flapping swimmers arranged in one- and two-dimensional lattice formations. Our 1D results exhibit good agreement with previously published experimental data, in particular predicting the bistability of schooling states and new instabilities that can be probed in experimental settings. For 2D lattices, we determine the formations for which swimmers optimally benefit from hydrodynamic interactions. Generally, our self-consistent modeling framework may be broadly applicable to active systems in which the collective dynamics is primarily driven by a fluid-mediated memory.},

	abstract = {Experiments were performed on an oscillating foil to assess its performance in producing large forces for propulsion and effective maneuvering. First, experiments on a harmonically heaving and pitching foil were performed to determine its propulsive efficiency under conditions of significant thrust production, as function of the principal parameters: the heave amplitude, Strouhal number, angle of attack, and phase angle between heave and pitch. Planform area thrust coefficients of 2.4 were recorded for 351 maximum angle of attack and efficiencies of up to 71.5 \% were recorded for 151 maximum angle of attack. A plateau of good efficiency, in the range of 50–60\%, is noted. A phase angle of 90–1001 between pitch and heave is found to produce the best thrust performance. Also, the introduction of higher harmonics in the heave motion, so as to ensure a sinusoidal variation in the angle of attack produced much higher thrust coefficient at high Strouhal numbers. Second, experiments on a harmonically oscillating foil with a superposed pitch bias, as well as experiments on impulsively moving foils in still water, were conducted to assess the capability of the foil to produce large lateral forces for maneuvering. Mean side force coefficients of up to 5.5, and instantaneous lift coefficients of up to 15 were recorded, demonstrating an outstanding capability for maneuvering force production.},

	abstract = {The aerodynamic forces on a flat plate accelerating from rest at fixed incidence in two-dimensional power-law flow are studied analytically and numerically. An inviscid approximation is made in which separation at the two plate edges is modelled by growing spiral vortex sheets, whose evolution is determined by the Birkhoff–Rott equation. A solution based on a similarity expansion is developed, valid when the scale of the separated vortex is much smaller than the plate dimension. The leading order is given by the well-known similarity growth of a vortex sheet from a semi-infinite flat plate, while equations at the second order describe the asymmetric sweeping effect of that component of the free-stream parallel to the plate. Owing to subtle cancellation, the unsteady vortex force exerted on the plate during the starting motion is independent of the sweeping effect and is determined by the similarity solution, to the order calculated. This gives a mechanism for dynamic stall based on a combination of unsteady vortex lift and pure added mass; the incidence angle for maximum vortex lift is \${\textbackslash}arccos {\textbackslash}sqrt\{3/8\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}approx\}{\textbackslash},52.2{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ independent of the acceleration profile. Circulation on the flat plate makes no direct contribution. Both lift and drag force predictions from the unsteady inviscid theory are compared with those obtained from numerical solutions of the two-dimensional unsteady Navier–Stokes equations for an ellipse of high aspect ratio, and with predictions of Wagner's classical theory. There is good agreement with numerical results at high incidence and moderate Reynolds number. The force per unit span predicted by the vortex theory is evaluated for parameters typical of insect wings and is found to be in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations. Estimates for the shed circulation and the size of the start-up vortices are also obtained. The significance of this flow as a mechanism for insect hovering flight is discussed.},

Studies of insect flight have focused on aerodynamic lift, both in quasi-steady and unsteady regimes. This is partly influenced by the choice of hovering motions along a horizontal stroke plane, where aerodynamic drag makes no contribution to the vertical force. In contrast, some of the best hoverers– dragonflies and hoverflies – employ inclined stroke planes, where the drag in the down- and upstrokes does not cancel each other. Here, computation of an idealized dragonfly wing motion shows that a dragonfly uses drag to support about three quarters of its weight. This can explain an anomalous factor of four in previous estimates of dragonfly lift coefficients, where drag was assumed to be small.
To investigate force generation and energy cost of hovering flight using different combination of lift and drag, I study a family of wing motion parameterized by the inclined angle of the stroke plane. The lift-to-drag ratio is no longer a measure of efficiency, except in the case of horizontal stroke plane. In addition, because the flow is highly stalled, lift and drag are of comparable magnitude, and the aerodynamic efficiency is roughly the same up to an inclined angle about 60°, which curiously agrees with the angle observed in dragonfly flight.
Finally, the lessons from this special family of wing motion suggests a strategy for improving efficiency of normal hovering, and a unifying view of different wing motions employed by insects.},

By varying the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation we visualize a variety of wakes with up to 16 vortices per oscillation period, including von Kármán vortex street, inverted von Kármán vortex street, 2P wake, 2P+2S wake and novel wakes ranging from 4P to 8P. We map out the wake types in a phase diagram spanned by the width-based Strouhal number and the dimensionless amplitude. We follow the time evolution of the vortex formation near the round leading edge and the shedding process at the sharp trailing edge in detail. This allows us to identify the origins of the vortices in the 2P wake, to understand that two distinct 2P regions are present in the phase diagram due to the timing of the vortex shedding at the leading edge and the trailing edge and to propose a simple model for the vorticity generation. We use the model to describe the transition from 2P wake to 2S wake with increasing oscillation frequency and the transition from the von Kármán wake, typically associated with drag, to the inverted von Kármán wake, typically associated with thrust generation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address a crucial point regarding the description of moderate to high Reynolds numbers aquatic swimmers. For decades, swimming animals have been classified in two different families of propulsive mechanisms based on the Reynolds number: the "resistive" swimmers, using local friction to produce the necessary thrust force for locomotion at low Reynolds number and the "reactive" swimmers, lying in the high Reynolds range, and using added mass acceleration (described by perfect fluid theory). However, inertial swimmers are also systems that dissipate energy, due to their finite size, therefore involving strong resistive contributions, even for high Reynolds numbers. Using a complete model for the hydrodynamic forces, involving both reactive and resistive contributions, we revisit here the physical mechanisms responsible for the thrust production of such swimmers. We show, for instance, that the resistive part of the force balance is as crucial as added mass effects in the modeling of the thrust force, especially for elongated species. The conclusions brought by this work may have significant contributions to the understanding of complex swimming mechanisms, especially for the future design of artificial swimmers.},

Using a beam model coupled with Lighthill’s large-amplitude elongated-body theory, we explore different localised actuations at one extremity of the plate (heaving, pitching and a combination of both) in order to quantify the reactive and resistive contributions to the thrust. The latter has the form of a quadratic drag in large Reynolds number swimmers and has recently been pointed out as a crucial element in the thrust force balance. We validate the output of a weakly nonlinear solution to the fluid–structure model using thrust force measurements from an experiment with flexible plates subjected to the three different actuation types. The model is subsequently used in a self-propelled configuration – with a skin friction model that balances thrust to produce a constant cruising speed – to map the reactive versus resistive thrust production in a parameter space defined by the aspect ratio and the actuation frequency. We show that this balance is modified as the frequency of excitation changes and the response of the elastic plate shifts between different resonant modes, the pure heaving case being the most sensitive to the modal response with drastic changes in the reactive/resistive contribution ratio along the frequency axis. We analyse also the role of the phase lag between the heaving and pitching components in the case of combined actuation, showing in particular a non-trivial effect on the propulsive efficiency.},

We compare computational, experimental and quasi-steady forces in a generic hovering wing undergoing sinusoidal motion along a horizontal stroke plane. In particular, we investigate unsteady effects and compare two-dimensional (2D) computations and three-dimensional (3D) experiments in several qualitatively different kinematic patterns. In all cases, the computed drag compares well with the experiments. The computed lift agrees in the cases in which the sinusoidal changes in angle of attack are symmetrical or advanced with respect to stroke positions, but lags behind the measured 3D lift in the delayed case.
In the range of amplitudes studied here, 3–5 chords, the force coefficients have a weak dependence on stroke amplitude. As expected, the forces are sensitive to the phase between stroke angle and angle of attack, a result that can be explained by the orientation of the wing at reversal. This dependence on amplitude and phase suggests a simple maneuver strategy that could be used by a flapping wing device.
In all cases the unsteady forces quickly reach an almost periodic state with continuous flapping. The fluid forces are dominated by the pressure contribution. The force component directly proportional to the linear acceleration is smaller by a factor proportional to the ratio of wing thickness and stroke amplitude; its net contribution is zero in hovering. The ratio of wing inertia and fluid force is proportional to the product of the ratio of wing and fluid density and the ratio of wing thickness and stroke amplitude; it is negligible in the robotic wing experiment, but need not be in insect flight.
To identify unsteady effects associated with wing acceleration, and coupling between rotation and translation, as well as wake capture, we examine the difference between the unsteady forces and the estimates based on translational velocities, and compare them against the estimate of the coupling between rotation and translation, which have simple analytic forms for sinusoidal motions. The agreement and disagreement between the computed forces and experiments offer further insight into when the 3D effects are important.
A main difference between a 3D revolving wing and a 2D translating wing is the absence of vortex shedding by a revolving wing over a distance much longer than the typical stroke length of insects. No doubt such a difference in shedding dynamics is responsible in part for the differences in steady state force coefficients measured in 2D and 3D. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such differences would have a significant effect on transient force coefficients before the onset of shedding. While the 2D steady state force coefficients underpredict 3D forces, the transient 2D forces measured prior to shedding are much closer to the 3D forces. In the cases studied here, the chord is moving between 3 to 5 chords, typical of hovering insect stroke length, and the flow does not appear to separate during each stroke in the cases of advanced and symmetrical rotation. In these cases, the wing reverses before the leading edge vortex would have time to separate even in 2D. This suggests that the time scale for flow separation in these strokes is dictated by the flapping frequency, which is dimensionally independent. In such cases, the 2D unsteady forces turn out to be good approximations of 3D experiments.},

The model dynamics is investigated analytically and discussed with regard to the choice of the coupling terms and the values of model parameters. Closed-form relations of the model response are derived and compared to experimental results on forced and free vortex-induced vibrations. This allows us to set the values of all model parameters, then leads to the choice or the most appropriate coupling model.

For a given object shape, this drag can involve skin friction or form drag, both being well-documented mechanisms. However, for swimmers whose shape is changing in time, the question of drag is not yet clearly established. We address this problem by investigating experimentally the swimming dynamics of undulating thin flexible foils. Measurements of the propulsive performance together with full recording of the elastic wave kinematics are used to discuss the general problem of drag in undulatory swimming. We show that a major part of the total drag comes from the trailing longitudinal vortices that roll-up on the lateral edges of the foils. This result gives a comparative advantage to swimming foils of larger span thus bringing new insight to the role of aspect ratio for undulatory swimmers.},

This reveals the existence of two critical reduced frequencies above which the added mass reaction and the rotational forces start to compete with the quasi steady circulatory forces which dominate the lower frequency regimes. We also show that an increase in the frequencies of these movement leads to a reduction of the leading edge vortex (LEV) size and to promotion of the wake capture mechanism. A frequency diagram is proposed where the various critical frequencies are listed and were three regimes are emphasized : a quasi steady regime, a transitional regime in which unsteady effects interact with quasi steady forces, and a pure unsteady regime in which unsteady forces are dominant. A comparison with living species show that these three different regimes correspond respectively to birds, large insects and small insects. Then, we study a realistic motion where heaving, pitching and sliding motions are combined. Using a kinematics adapted to a quasi steady regime, we show that when frequency is increased, the lift and the thrust are first leaded by the rotational force in the transitional regime. Reduction of the LEV size and wing wake interactions then distort the instantaneous efforts during the upstroke, whereas the contribution of the added mass reaction still remains unclear.},

The current explanation, analogous to a mechanism operating on delta-wing aircraft, is that spanwise flow through a spiral vortex drains energy from the vortex core3. We have tested this hypothesis by systematically mapping the flow generated by a dynamically scaled model insect while simultaneously measuring the resulting aerodynamic forces. Here we report that, at the Reynolds numbers matching the flows relevant for most insects, flapping wings do not generate a spiral vortex akin to that produced by delta-wing aircraft. We also find that limiting spanwise flow with fences and edge baffles does not cause detachment of the leading-edge vortex. The data support an alternative hypothesis—that downward flow induced by tip vortices limits the growth of the leading-edge vortex.},

Fluid Mech., vol. 812, 2017, R4), close examination of the flow pattern behind a flapping wing will inform us whether the wing is towed by an external force or able to generate a net thrust force by itself.

The drop, usually a simple ‘bouncer’, undergoes a drift bifurcation when the forcing amplitude is increased. It thus becomes a ‘walker’ propagating at a constant velocity on the interface. This transition occurs just below the Faraday instability threshold, when the drop becomes a local emitter of a parametrically forced wave. A model of the particle–wave interaction accounts for this drift bifurcation. The self-organization of several identical bouncers is also investigated. At low forcing, bouncers form bound states or crystal-like aggregates. At larger forcing, the collisions between walkers reveal that their interaction can be either repulsive or attractive, depending on their distance apart. The attraction leads to the spontaneous formation of orbiting pairs, the possible orbit diameters forming a discrete set. A theoretical model of the non-local interaction resulting from the interference of the waves is given. The nature of the interaction is thus clarified and the various types of self-organization recovered.},

The techniques showcased here are readily applicable to large-scale flow configurations consisting of n-periodic arrays of identical and coupled fluid components, as can be found, for example, in turbomachinery, ring flame holders, or nozzle exit corrugations. Only minor corrections to existing solvers have to be implemented to allow this present type of analysis.},

	abstract = {Classic models of fish schools and flying formations of birds are built on the hypothesis that the preferred locations of an individual are determined by the flow left by its upstream neighbor. Lighthill posited that arrangements may in fact emerge passively from hydro- or aerodynamic interactions, drawing an analogy to the formation of crystals by intermolecular forces. Here, we carry out physical experiments aimed at testing the Lighthill conjecture and find that self-propelled flapping wings spontaneously assume one of multiple arrangements due to flow interactions. Wings in a tandem pair select the same forward speed, which tends to be faster than a single wing, while maintaining a separation distance that is an integer multiple of the wavelength traced out by each body. When perturbed, these locomotors robustly return to the same arrangement, and direct hydrodynamic force measurements reveal springlike restoring forces that maintain group cohesion. We also use these data to construct an interaction potential, showing how the observed positions of the follower correspond to stable wells in an energy landscape. Flow visualization and vortex-based theoretical models reveal coherent interactions in which the follower surfs on the periodic wake left by the leader. These results indicate that, for the high-Reynolds-number flows characteristic of schools and flocks, collective locomotion at enhanced speed and in orderly formations can emerge from flow interactions alone. If true for larger groups, then the view of collectives as ordered states of matter may prove to be a useful analogy.},

	abstract = {Les oiseaux et poissons se déplacent dans leur environnement fluide en interagissan avec l'air/eau qui les entoure. Pour des régimes inertiels, les mécaniques de propulsion se basent sur un transfert de quantité de mouvement au fluide ; les battements d'ailes ou de nageoires générant un jet dans le sillage de l'animal qui le propulse vers l'avant. Pour les oiseaux comme pour les poissons, les structures utilisées possèdent une certaine flexibilité, et sont donc susceptibles de plier de façon importante. La littérature montre que ces déformations passives peuvent améliorer les performances de propulsion lorsqu'elles sont exploitées de façon constructive. Le détail des mécanismes en jeu reste cependant mal compris. L'objectif de cette thèse est d'étudier, à travers deux modèles biomimétiques, la façon dont une structure battante déformable génère des forces de propulsion. Le premier modèle est une version mécanique simplifiée d'insecte dotée d'ailes flexibles, tandis que le deuxième est un nageur dont le corps élastique reproduit le mouvement d'ondulation d'une anguille. Nous montrons que la façon dont ces systèmes se déforment passivement est déterminante pour leurs performances, et que leur réponse élastique peut être décrite par des modèles théoriques simplifiés d'oscillateurs forcés. Ces modélisations mettent par ailleurs en avant le rôle crucial joué par le frottement fluide quadratique qui s'oppose aux mouvements de battements de la structure. Ce résultat introduit l'idée, un peu contre-intuitive, qu'il peut s'avérer avantageux de dissiper une part de son énergie dans le fluide pour améliorer ses performances.},

Fatigue analysis is performed using rain-flow counting and Palmgren-Miner linear damage assumption; the contribution to life-time fatigue damage from deterministic load variations is quantified, as well as the contributions from operation at different mean wind speeds. A method is proposed to retrieve an estimation of the load frequencies yielding the highest fatigue contributions from the bending moment spectra. The results are in good agreement with rain-flow counting analysis on filtered time series, and, for the blade loads, show dominant contributions from frequencies close to the rotational one; negligible fatigue contributions are reported for loads with frequencies above 2 Hz.},

	abstract = {Temperature fluctuations generated by the mixing of hot and cold fluids at a T-junction, which is widely used in nuclear power and process plants, can cause thermal fatigue failure. The conventional methods for evaluating thermal fatigue tend to provide insufficient accuracy, because they were developed based on limited experimental data and a simplified one-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA). CFD/FEA coupling analysis is expected as a useful tool for the more accurate evaluation of thermal fatigue. The present paper aims to verify the accuracy of proposed numerical methods of simulating fluid and structure temperature fluctuations at a T-junction for thermal fatigue evaluation. The dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) is used for large eddy simulation (LES) sub-grid scale (SGS) turbulence model, and a hybrid scheme (HS) is adopted for the calculation of convective terms in the governing equations. Also, heat transfer between fluid and structure is calculated directly through thermal conduction by creating a mesh with near wall resolution (NWR) by allocating grid points within the thermal boundary sub-layer. The simulation results show that the distribution of fluid temperature fluctuation intensity and the range of structure temperature fluctuation are remarkably close to the experimental results. Moreover, the peak frequencies of power spectrum density (PSD) of both fluid and structure temperature fluctuations also agree well with the experimental results. Therefore, the numerical methods used in the present paper are of sufficiently high accuracy to be suitable for the CFD prediction of highly fluctuating flow and temperature fields.},

Boudaoud, Nature 437, 208 (2005)]. The system consists of a millimetric droplet self-propeling along the surface of a vibrating bath through a resonant interaction with its own wave field [J. W. M. Bush, Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 47, 269–292 (2015)]. There are three critical ingredients for the quantum like-behavior. The first is “path memory” [A. Eddi, E. Sultan, J. Moukhtar, E. Fort, M. Rossi, and Y. Couder, J. Fluid Mech. 675, 433–463 (2011)], which renders the system non-Markovian: the instantaneous wave force acting on the droplet depends explicitly on its past. The second is the resonance condition between droplet and wave that ensures a highly structured monochromatic pilot wave field that imposes an effective potential on the walking droplet, resulting in preferred, quantized states. The third ingredient is chaos, which in several systems is characterized by unpredictable switching between unstable periodic orbits. This focus issue is devoted to recent studies of and relating to pilot-wave hydrodynamics, a field that attempts to answer the following simple but provocative question: Might deterministic chaotic pilot-wave dynamics underlie quantum statistics?},

Previous fluid-dynamical models of these collective behaviors assume that all individuals flap identically, whereas animal groups involve variations across members as well as active modifications of wing or fin motions. To study the roles of flapping kinematics and flow interactions, we design a minimal robotic “school” of two hydrofoils swimming in tandem. The flapping kinematics of each foil are independently prescribed and systematically varied, while the forward swimming motions are free and result from the fluid forces. Surprisingly, a pair of uncoordinated foils with dissimilar kinematics can swim together cohesively—without separating or colliding—due to the interaction of the follower with the wake left by the leader. For equal flapping frequencies, the follower experiences stable positions in the leader’s wake, with locations that can be controlled by flapping amplitude and phase. Further, a follower with lower flapping speed can defy expectation and keep up with the leader, whereas a faster-flapping follower can be buffered from collision and oscillate in the leader’s wake. We formulate a reduced-order model which produces remarkable agreement with all experimentally observed modes by relating the follower’s thrust to its flapping speed relative to the wake flow. These results show how flapping kinematics can be used to control locomotion within wakes, and that flow interactions provide a mechanism which promotes group cohesion.},

For this purpose, we characterize experimentally the “promenade modes” where two walkers are bound and propagate together. Their possible binding distances take discrete values, and the velocity of the pair depends on their mutual binding. The mean parallel motion can be either rectilinear or oscillating.

	abstract = {It has recently been demonstrated that droplets walking on a vibrating fluid bath exhibit several features previously thought to be peculiar to the microscopic realm. The walker, consisting of a droplet plus its guiding wavefield, is a spatially extended object. We here examine the dependence of the walker mass and momentum on its velocity. Doing so indicates that, when the walker’s time scale of acceleration is long relative to the wave decay time, its dynamics may be described in terms of the mechanics of a particle with a speed-dependent mass and a nonlinear drag force that drives it towards a fixed speed. Drawing an analogy with relativistic mechanics, we define a hydrodynamic boost factor for the walkers. This perspective provides a new rationale for the anomalous orbital radii reported in recent studies.},

	abstract = {On a vertically vibrating fluid interface, a droplet can remain bouncing indefinitely. When approaching the Faraday instability onset, the droplet couples to the wave it generates and starts propagating horizontally. The resulting wave–particle association, called a walker, was shown previously to have remarkable dynamical properties, reminiscent of quantum behaviours. In the present article, the nature of a walker's wave field is investigated experimentally, numerically and theoretically. It is shown to result from the superposition of waves emitted by the droplet collisions with the interface. A single impact is studied experimentally and in a fluid mechanics theoretical approach. It is shown that each shock emits a radial travelling wave, leaving behind a localized mode of slowly decaying Faraday standing waves. As it moves, the walker keeps generating waves and the global structure of the wave field results from the linear superposition of the waves generated along the recent trajectory. For rectilinear trajectories, this results in a Fresnel interference pattern of the global wave field. Since the droplet moves due to its interaction with the distorted interface, this means that it is guided by a pilot wave that contains a path memory. Through this wave-mediated memory, the past as well as the environment determines the walker's present motion.},

Delayed stall functions during the translational portions of the stroke, when the wings sweep through the air with a large angle of attack. In contrast, rotational circulation and wake capture generate aerodynamic forces during stroke reversals, when the wings rapidly rotate and change direction. In addition to contributing to the lift required to keep an insect aloft, these two rotational mechanisms provide a potent means by which the animal can modulate the direction and magnitude of flight forces during steering maneuvers. A comprehensive theory incorporating both translational and rotational mechanisms may explain the diverse patterns of wing motion displayed by different species of insects.},

	abstract = {In this thesis a novel non-body conforming mesh formulation is developed, called the moving immersed boundary method (MIBM), for the numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The primary goal is to enable solids of complex shape to move arbitrarily in an incompressible viscous fluid, without fitting the solid boundary motion with dynamic meshes. This novel method enforces the no-slip boundary condition exactly at the fluid-solid interface with a boundary force, without introducing any artificial constants to the rigid body formulation. As a result, large time step can be used in current method. To determine the boundary force more efficiently in case of moving boundaries, an additional moving force equation is derived and the resulting system is solved by the conjugate gradient method. The proposed method is highly portable and can be integrated into any fluid solver as a plug-in. In the present thesis, the MIBM is implemented in the fluid solver based on the projection method. In order to obtain results of high accuracy, the rotational incremental pressure correction projection method is adopted, which is free of numerical boundary layer and is second order accurate. To accelerate the calculation of the pressure Poisson equation, the multi-grid method is employed as a preconditioner together with the conjugate gradient method as a solver. The code is further parallelized on the graphics processing unit (GPU) with the CUDA library to enjoy high performance computing. At last, the proposed MIBM is applied to the study of two-way FSI problem. For stability and modularity reasons, a partitioned implicit scheme is selected for this strongly coupled problem. The interface matching of fluid and solid variables is realized through a fixed point iteration. To reduce the computational cost, a novel efficient coupling scheme is proposed by removing the time-consuming pressure Poisson equation from this fixed point interaction. The proposed method has shown a promising performance in modeling complex FSI system.},
